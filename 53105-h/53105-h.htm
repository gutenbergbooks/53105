<h2 class="p4"><i>INTRODUCTION.</i></h2>

<hr class="d3" />

<p class="drop-cap00">I HAVE been asked to write a short introduction
to this volume of the Camden Library, and
I do so with great pleasure.</p>

<p>The subject of sculptured signs is one of considerable
interest, to which too little attention
has hitherto been devoted, and the treatment of
this important section of London antiquities could
not have fallen into better hands than into those
of Mr. Philip Norman, who has devoted many
years of patient labour to the search for these
signs, which are often found in very out-of-the-way
localities. Mr. Norman possesses one most
important qualification for the task he has undertaken,
in that he is an accomplished artist. He
is thus doubly well equipped both as an antiquary
and as an artist.</p>

<p>It will, I think, surprise many readers to learn
that so much is still left to us, and I hope that the
attention drawn to some of the signs which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
disappeared of late years may result in the discovery
of their present hiding-places. Some years
ago there was a curious sculptured sign over the
entrance to Bull Head Court, Newgate Street.
This represented William Evans, Charles I.’s
gigantic porter, and Jeffrey Hudson, the Queen’s
dwarf. When King Edward Street was widened
this sign disappeared. If it be still in existence,
we may hope that, in course of time, it may find
a home in the Guildhall Museum, where so many
interesting relics of old London are preserved.</p>

<p>Painted signs, which were once almost universal,
were suddenly cleared away by the Act of
Parliament of 1762, but these sculptured signs
remained because they were a part of the houses
to which they were attached, and they only pass
away when the houses are rebuilt.</p>

<p>As the reader casually turns over the pages of
this book, he cannot fail to be struck by the
variety of objects which have been represented on
the signs. Many of these may be considered as
marks of ownership, and the crests and coats of
arms of the City Companies are frequently found
as signs.</p>

<p>In connection with the æsthetic revival there
has been a considerable reappearance of signs in
different parts of London, mostly of artistic ironwork;
but although this helps to relieve the dull
monotony of many streets it is not a custom that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
would be popular if it became universal. There
can, however, be no objection to the more general
adoption of artistic sculpture on the fronts of
houses. When an old house is rebuilt, its story
(if it have a story) may with advantage be
graphically represented on the front of the new
one. This has been done in some cases, and
an extension of the custom would add to the
beauty of the streets, and increase the interest
of the passer-by in the almost forgotten history
of his own town.</p>

<p>It is a satisfactory thing that the relics of former
fashions of decoration should be registered for the
information of those who desire to keep themselves
in touch with the history of the past.
Even in this materialistic age there are many who
love to live in imagination in a former age, and a
sculptured sign or inscription on an old house
will often help them to do this.</p>

<p>For centuries London was remarkable for its
gardens, but this has been changed at the end of
the nineteenth century. Considering the great
value of land in ‘the City,’ I suppose it cannot be
a matter of surprise that almost every bit of
garden or green place has been swept out of existence,
but I think every lover of London will
sympathize with the protest against this tendency
which concludes Mr. Norman’s book.</p>

<p>I do not, however, wish to keep the reader longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
from learning what the author has to say, and I
will only add that this volume will form a most
useful and agreeable addition to the extensive literature
which is gradually growing up in connection
with the ever-increasing world of houses and men
which is known as London.</p>

<hr class="d3" />

<p class="drop-cap04">UNTIL the beginning of this century, I may
almost say till the development of our
railway system some fifty years ago, though
London was continually spreading in all directions,
its heart&mdash;the City&mdash;remained very much as Wren
had left it. Here many a well-to-do trader was
content to dwell in the substantial house in which
his business was carried on, and to pray in the
neighbouring parish church where his father had
prayed before him. Now the church has, likely
enough, disappeared, the monuments of his ancestors
are bundled off no one knows where; perhaps
the very street in which he lived is changed out
of all power of recognition. In short, to meet
our modern requirements, the City has become a
mere mass of offices, warehouses, and gigantic
railway-stations, whence issue each morning
myriads of human beings who spend the day in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
struggling for wealth or a livelihood, and at night
return to their homes, which are spread over an
area some sixty miles in diameter, leaving the
centre to be protected by a few porters and caretakers.
The decrease in the resident population
has now extended a considerable distance west.</p>

<p>To the observing eye, however, traces of a
former state of things are still to be seen, not only
in important buildings such as the City halls, the
parish churches and the old merchants’ houses still
existing; but in objects less conspicuous, for instance,
the sculptured house and street signs which
came into fashion after the Great Fire. These
have no little artistic merit, and almost all are
interesting from their associations. The greater
part of my book is devoted to a careful description
of such signs; not only the existing ones, but all
of which I can find any mention. This description
I have tried to make as complete as possible,
and I have allowed myself some latitude, recording
not only facts which appeared to me of interest
concerning the particular house, court, or alley to
which the sign belonged, but also its probable
origin, and any story or legend that might be connected
with it.</p>

<p>Sculptured signs are often heraldic, and from
them the transition is natural to still existing
crests and coats of arms carved on buildings in
various parts of the town. A cognate subject is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
that of old dates and inscriptions, suggestive as
they are of the former ownership of property, of
changes in the names of streets, sometimes even
giving us glimpses of family history; as in the
inscription to Denzil Lord Holles.</p>

<p>My researches naturally led me into the Guildhall
Museum, where the need of a suitable catalogue
(soon, I hear, to be supplied), induced me
to put together a few suggestive notes on the
curiosities relating to London which there find a
home. I have added a short account of some
half dozen of the painted signs still existing in the
Metropolis which seemed to have more than
common interest.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the extraordinary
decrease of City inhabitants. On the other hand,
in outlying districts the converse process has
taken place. The little towns and villages of
three hundred years ago, then some distance from
London, and numbering among their inhabitants
people of high birth unconnected with trade,
became by degrees half rural suburbs, where well-to-do
citizens sought amusement and repose.
Folks of this class have now gone further afield,
and for many years the speculative builder has been
at work, providing for a humbler and far more
numerous population. The space is covered with
miles upon miles of dull monotonous streets; pleasant
gardens have disappeared, hills are levelled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
valleys filled up, wells choked, the clear streams
turned into sewers, nothing remaining to remind
us of what has gone before except the names, and
here and there an old house, a carving or inscription.
The existence of a few of these mementoes
has attracted me to Islington and Clerkenwell, and
must be my excuse for describing in detail several
of the spas and places of entertainment with which
in the eighteenth century this region abounded.
Thence I make my way back to the City, and
while exploring the picturesque districts of Great
St. Helen’s and Austin Friars, I give an account
of two remarkable old City mansions lately destroyed,
which may fairly claim a place; for
one was distinguished by an elaborate coat of
arms, and the other by an interesting date and
initials. This latter was of no small architectural
merit, while both were the homes of eminent
citizens.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should add that the subject of sculptured
signs has been briefly treated by me in the
pages of the <i>Antiquary</i>, and that for the <i>English
Illustrated Magazine</i>, of Christmas, 1891, I wrote
and illustrated an article on old City mansions,
including those which are here more completely
described.</p>

<p>In the course of the text I have indicated
sources of information, and have acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
help from several good friends. I wish here in an
especial manner to thank Mr. Henry B. Wheatley,
F.S.A. As I am indebted to him for an introduction
to this volume, it would perhaps not be
becoming to dwell over-much on the merits of his
great work, ‘London Past and Present,’ based on
Peter Cunningham’s Handbook; I find myself
constantly referring to it, and always with advantage.
Lord Tennyson has kindly allowed me to
quote four lines dictated by his illustrious father,
which have not before appeared in print.</p>

<p>The illustrations I venture to commend, for
few of them are the work of my hand. They
have at least one great merit, that of being
scrupulously accurate.</p>

<p>Allusion is made in the text to Mr. Tarbolton’s
valuable contribution. There is a fine drawing by
Mr. F. E. Cox; while Mr. E. M. Cox contributes
a whole series, the merits of which speak for
themselves. The Three Kings, the Bell, and
the Boar’s Head may be named as specimens.
Mr. Fletcher did the charming little sketch of an
inscription formerly over the entrance to Bagnigge
Wells, with its grotesque head; and the editors
of the <i>Strand Magazine</i> and the <i>Builder</i> have
allowed me the use of blocks from their respective
publications.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me express a hope that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
kind reader will not class this volume in the category
of ‘books which are no books,’ as Charles
Lamb puts it, or even as one ‘which no gentleman’s
library should be without,’ but that he will
find here some useful and curious information, put
together in a form sufficiently agreeable to make
him wish for more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">HUMAN SIGNS.</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Be sure observe the signs, for signs remain<br />
Like faithful landmarks to the walking train.’</p>

<p class="pr12 reduct"><span class="smcap">Gay</span>: <i>Trivia</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">UNTIL the early part of the eighteenth
century, when the plan of numbering
came into vogue, not only inns and taverns, but
shops and other houses, were distinguished by
signs. The wholesale traders, indeed, were as a
rule sufficiently well known not to require this
distinctive mark. In the ‘Little London Directory’
for the year 1677&mdash;the oldest printed list of
the kind&mdash;hardly any of the merchants have signs.
The reverse is the case with the bankers, who,
as ‘goldsmiths that keep running cashes,’ had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
then hardly emerged from the shopkeeper class.
Nevertheless, signs were exceedingly common; on
the rebuilding of the city, immediately after the
Great Fire, many of them, instead of being
painted and hung out&mdash;though this continued
to be the more usual method&mdash;were carved in
stone and built into the plain brick fronts of
the new houses, generally above or below a
first-floor window. In some cases also, the
name of a court or alley was thus indicated&mdash;a
useful method when a large number of the
population could neither read nor write. It is
curious that signs of a very similar description
were used by the Romans; for instance, the
well-known terra-cotta bas-relief of two men
carrying an amphora, and a figure of a goat,
both found at Pompeii; the former almost
identical in design with our conventional representation
of the Two Brewers. These, however,
were cast in a mould which was probably used
again and again. They therefore, perhaps, indicated
a trade rather than a particular house; like
our modern pawnbrokers’, tobacconists’, and gold-beaters’
signs. I shall presently call attention to
a London seventeenth-century sign repeated in the
same way.</p>

<p>Our plan seems to have been adopted from the
Continent, where many stone signs are still to be
found. They are commonest in Holland and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Low Countries. Here, perhaps ever since the
Roman occupation, certainly since the days of
Charlemagne, brick has been the usual building
material, for it must have been that which was
most easily available. Fortunately many of the
old Dutch houses still survive; they hang together
with wonderful pertinacity in spite of bad foundations,
and beautiful specimens of picturesque
architecture they are, with their step gables and
stone ornamentation. The Dutch signs are often
spirited and elaborate in design; they are to be
found of all ages from about the year 1550 till
near the end of the eighteenth century, but as
might be expected, the earlier ones, which are
often historical, are the best. They were placed
like those in London, and generally had an ornamental
border. Sometimes in place of a sign
there was a pious distich or inscription, sometimes
merely a date. A capital book on Dutch signs by
J. Van Lennep and J. Ter Gouw has lately been
published. Many of these signs from buildings
now destroyed are to be seen in an annexe of the
fine modern picture-gallery in Amsterdam. I am
glad to say that our City authorities have shown a
like respect for similar relics of old London, and
some interesting specimens have found a home in
the Guildhall Museum. Others have disappeared,
and a certain number are still more or less in their
original positions.</p>

<p>In the following pages I shall try to describe all
the London sculptured signs of which we have any
record; for convenience I have classified them, and
naturally begin with those in which human beings
are represented. One of the most interesting and
best known is the sign of the Boy and Panyer,
which is still to be seen, its base resting on the
ground, and let into the wall between two houses
on the eastern side of Panyer Alley, a narrow
passage leading from Paternoster Row to Newgate
Street. It represents a naked boy seated on a
pannier or basket, and holding what, in Strype’s
time, appeared to be a bunch of grapes between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
his hand and foot, ‘in token perhaps of plenty,’
as he suggests. Within an ornamental border,
apparently on a separate stone below, is the following
inscription:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘When ye have sought the Citty round,<br />
Yet still this is the highest ground.</p>
<p class="pr12 reduct"><i>August the</i> 27, 1688.’</p>

<p class="p1">Height fifty-two inches, breadth in the broadest
part twenty-six inches. It is now much dilapidated,
and seems to be in some danger of destruction,
for one of the houses against which it stands is
shortly to be pulled down.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> However, I am
assured that proper steps will be taken for its
preservation. The property belongs by right
to the parish of St. Michael-le-Querne, having
been left in 1620 by Sir John Leman and Cornelius
Fishe for parochial uses, but it is now handed over
to the Trustees of City Parochial Charities.</p>

<p>The sign no doubt dates from after the Great
Fire; it seems, however, to represent a previous
one. Stow, writing in 1598, says that Panyer
Alley was ‘so called of such a sign,’ and confirming
his statement, a Panyer, Paternoster Row,
appears in a list of taverns of about the year 1430,
which Mr. Charles Welch, F.S.A., lately discovered
among the documents of the Brewers’
Company, the landlord, John Ives, having been
a member of that company. From ‘Liber Albus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>’
which relates to the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, one learns that in those days the sale
of bread was not allowed to take place in the
bakers’ houses, but only in the King’s markets.
It was sold in bread-baskets or ‘panyers,’ and,
the coarser kinds at any rate, occasionally in boxes
or hutches.</p>

<p>Mr. H. T. Riley in his introduction to ‘Liber
Albus’ (p. lxviii.) stated it as his opinion that the
child is handing out a loaf, and that at a period
somewhat later than the date of that volume (1419)
Panyer Alley was noted as a standing place for
bakers’ boys with their panniers. If, as seems not
unlikely, this was the case, the sign would be
similar to the Baker and Basket, still existing in
Whitechapel and in Finsbury. Another idea&mdash;that
the pannier is in point of fact a fruit-basket&mdash;seems
to arise from Strype’s statement that the boy has in
his hand a bunch of grapes. Fruit and vegetables
were doubtless landed from the river in the neighbourhood
of St. Paul’s. Porters carrying such
produce may have passed through, and rested themselves
in this short passage on their way to Newgate
Market, which, originally for corn and meal, was
after the Fire used for poultry, fruit, and vegetables,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
before it became exclusively a meat market.</p>

<p>Mr. Kerslake, in a passage since referred to
with approval by Professor Earle in his work on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
‘Land Charters and Saxonic Documents’ (1888),
tries to connect the sign with a far more remote
antiquity. He argues that it may have been
placed there to transmit the tradition of a wheatmaund-stone
(maund being a basket or pannier),
mentioned in a grant of King Alfred, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 889,
which indicated the site of the ancient corn market,
and was, in point of fact, a place where a porter
carrying a load of wheat could rest it, or the base
of a market cross.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It seems that the question of
a town house for the Bishop of the Mercians having
come before Alfred, he gave to Bishop Werfrith a
mansion or court, ‘æt hwæt mundes stane’&mdash;thus it
is spelt in the document&mdash;and probably granted him
a toll on the neighbouring market. I am not aware
of any further evidence in support of this theory.</p>

<p>The church of St. Michael-le-Querne, ad
Bladum, or at the Corne, which was destroyed in
the Great Fire, and not rebuilt, stood close to
Panyer Alley, at the extreme end of Paternoster
Row, and Stow says it was so called ‘because in
place thereof was sometime a corn market, stretching
by west to the shambles.’ The Rev. W. J.
Loftie tells us that at present the sign of the Boy
and Panyer is not on the highest point in the City,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
being fifty-nine feet, while the site of the Standard
in Cornhill is sixty feet above sea-level. Certainly
it is not on the highest point of Panyer Alley.
A writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i> has lately suggested
that the highest point in the City was at or near
Leadenhall Market, or the chancel of the primitive
St. Peter’s Church on Cornhill.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""

</div>

<p>A statuette, also representing a naked boy, not
sculptured in stone, but carved in wood, is placed
on a pedestal affixed to the wall of a public-house,
at the corner of Giltspur Street and Cock Lane,
called the Fortune of War. The spot was commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
known as Pie Corner: it is hardly necessary
to add that here ended the Great Fire of London.
The figure in question was put up after that event;
an engraving of it in Pennant’s account of London
shows the following inscription on the breast and
arms:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘This boy is in Memory Put up for the late Fire of
London, occasioned by the Sin of Gluttony, 1666.’</p>

<p class="pn1">Burn tells us that its propriety was on one occasion
thus supported by a Nonconformist preacher on
the anniversary of the Fire. He asserted that
the calamity could not be occasioned by the sin of
blasphemy, for in that case it would have begun in
Billingsgate; nor lewdness, for then Drury Lane
would have been first on fire; nor lying, for then
the flames had reached them from Westminster
Hall. ‘No, my beloved; it was occasioned by
the sin of gluttony, for it began at Pudding Lane
and ended at Pie Corner.’</p>

<p>The inscription has long been obliterated, and
no trace is to be seen of the little wings with which,
in Pennant’s illustration, the boy is furnished;
in 1816, however, they were still conspicuous,
and were painted bright yellow. In that curious
work&mdash;the ‘Vade-Mecum for Malt-worms’&mdash;which
was written about the year 1715, the Fortune
of War is mentioned as a well-known tavern.
Within the memory of man it had the unpleasing
reputation of being a house of call for resurrectionists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
who supplied the surgeons of St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital with subjects for dissection. It
was here that John Bishop, the body-snatcher, met
his accomplice Williams, before the murder of the
Italian boy Ferrari, for which and similar crimes
they were hanged in 1831.</p>

<p>Our quaint old chronicler, John Stow, says that
Pie Corner was ‘a place so called of such a sign,
sometime a fair inn for receipt of travellers,
but now divided into tenements.’ Strype in
1720 describes it as noted chiefly for ‘Cooks’
Shops and Pigs drest there during Bartholomew
Fair.’ There are several allusions to it in Ben
Jonson’s ‘Alchemist’ and other plays. The
sign of the Pie probably implied the bird now
usually called a magpie, but it might have been
derived from the Pye,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> or rules for finding out
the service of the day in the Roman Breviary,
or from the good cheer provided in this immediate
neighbourhood. Larwood and Hotten mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a stone sign of a Naked Boy with the date 1633
at Skipton-in-Craven.</p>

<p>A stone bas-relief of that mythical person, Guy,
Earl of Warwick, is still preserved on a house at
the corner of Warwick Lane and Newgate Street.
The figure is represented standing on a pedestal in
chain armour, with a conical helmet, a sword in
his right hand, and on his left arm a shield
chequy, or and azure, with a bend sinister ermine.
This seems to be wrongly copied from Guy’s
shield in the Rows Roll, which has a chevron
ermine, but one arm of the chevron is, from the
position of the shield, so foreshortened that it can
hardly be seen; hence the mistake. Above is the
date 1668, on one side the letters G. C., standing, I
suppose, for <span class="smcap">guido comes</span>; on the other a coat
of arms, three mascles on a bend, to whom belonging
I cannot say, so many families have this
charge. Below is the inscription: ‘Restored 1817.
J. Deakes, Archt.’</p>

<p>The general design somewhat resembles that of
a large figure in the chapel of St. Mary Magdalen
at Guy’s Cliff, near Warwick, which, as we learn
from a modern inscription in Latin, was hewn
out of the living rock by order of Richard de
Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, in the reign of
Henry VI., to mark the spot where Guy was
thought to have ended his days. This Richard
de Beauchamp obtained license to found here a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
chantry for two priests, and annexed land thereto
to the value of twenty-four marks per annum. It
had before been a hermitage. Stow tells us that
‘Eldernesse lane, which stretcheth north to the
high street of Newgate market, is now called
Warwicke lane, of an ancient house there, built
by an Earl of Warwicke, and since called Warwicke
Inn.’ Elsewhere he says: ‘In the 36th
of Henry VI. the greater estates of the realm
being called up to London, Richard Nevill Earl
of Warwick came with six hundred men all in
jackets embroidered with ragged staves before and
behind, and was lodged in Warwicke Lane, in
whose house there were oftentimes six oxen eaten
at breakfast, and every tavern was full of his
meat, for he that had any acquaintance in that
house might have there so much of sodden and
roast meat as he could prick and carry away upon
a long dagger.’ At the beginning of this century
the house to which the statuette belonged was
occupied by a Mr. Parry; an inscription over the
door stated that it had been a tobacconist’s shop
since 1660, no doubt rebuilt.</p>

<p>A well-modelled bas-relief of a woman’s head,
probably intended to represent Minerva, is on a
house belonging to the Leathersellers’ Company,
at the corner of Old Jewry and Gresham Street.
She has a helmet or diadem, and on her breast
the Gorgon’s head; an ægis also seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
suggested. On each side are festoons of fruit and
flowers; the material I believe to be terra-cotta,
but it is so thickly coated with paint that one
cannot be sure. Archer, who drew this sign,
thought it was a fragment of sculpture from a
building of the early part of the sixteenth century,
and it seems to have something in common with
Italian terra-cotta work of that period; for instance
the medallions<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> executed by Joannes Maiano for
Cardinal Wolsey, and still existing at Hampton
Court. Before the house was modernized, on the
brick wall, below the head of Minerva, there was
a carving of the Leathersellers’ Arms; and so,
being used as a tavern during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, until 1871 it was known by
the sign of the Leathersellers’ Arms, or latterly the
Three Bucks’ Heads. Of the sculptured head of
Minerva no record exists. This property seems
to have belonged to the Leathersellers’ Company
ever since the year 1565, when Edward Taylor,
who had been its master, left by will to the
company two messuages in St. Olave’s, Jewry, to
distribute among the poorest people in the Poultry
Compter a kilderkin of beer and twelve pennyworth
of bread, and the same to Wood Street
Compter, Newgate, the Fleet, King’s Bench, and
the Marshalsea. In 1878 all arrears of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
payments to each prison at £1 1s. per quarter,
viz. for a kilderkin of beer £1, and for bread 1s.,
having been paid to this date, and the full payment
being £25 4s. a year, the company transferred
to the official trustees of charities stock sufficient
to produce that amount. The name of Cateaton
Street was in 1845 changed to Gresham Street,
no one knows why. Here, in the days of John
Taylor the water-poet, there was an important inn
called the Maidenhead, but this, I imagine, had for
its sign the arms of the Mercers’ Company, whose
headquarters were in its immediate neighbourhood.
Later a seventeenth-century trade token was issued
from the Roxalana’s Head in Cateaton Street,
the sign no doubt commemorating Elizabeth
Davenport the actress, whose favourite part
was Roxalana in the ‘Siege of Rhodes.’ Her
sham marriage with the last Earl of Oxford of
the de Vere family, who deceived her by disguising
a trumpeter of his troop as a priest, is
told in ‘Gramont,’ and in the ‘Countess Dunois’
Memoirs.’ Pepys saw her in 166⅔, in the chief
box at the Duke’s theatre, ‘in a velvet gown, as
the fashion is, looking very handsome.’</p>

<p>The Woman’s Head, dated 1671, which was on
a house in Paternoster Row, and has been lately
added to the Guildhall Museum, was hardly a sign.
Similar heads are still on the keys of a first and
second floor window belonging to the old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
house of Messrs. W. and R. Chambers, 47, Paternoster
Row. Another bas-relief in the Guildhall
Museum represents a gardener holding a spade in
his right hand, with the date 1670; it is rudely
designed. This is a street rather than a house
sign; as late as the year 1856 it was in Gardiner’s
Lane, Upper Thames Street, near Broken Wharf.
Mr. J. T. Smith, who drew it, in 1791, for his
‘Antiquities of London,’ adds this description:
‘Against Mr. Holyland’s stables, Gardiner’s Lane,
the corner of High Timber Street, is this sculpture,
but why put up I cannot learn. Tradition
says the site was once gardens.’ Perhaps it was a
rebus on the name of Gardiner.</p>

<p>Two bas-reliefs of St. George and the Dragon
were erected as signs in London soon after the
Great Fire, and, on the principle <i>Detur digniori</i>,
should be described in this chapter. It was only
natural that the figure of St. George should
become one of our most popular inn signs; for
he was regarded as the patron saint and special
protector of this our realm of England. Shakespeare
speaks of</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘St. George that swindg’d the Dragon, and e’er since<br />
Sits on his horseback at mine hostess’ door.’</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct">‘King John,’ Act i., Scene I.</p>

<p class="p1">A capital specimen of such a sign, though unfortunately
in bad condition, is at the Guildhall
Museum&mdash;presented by Mr. W. Hayward, C.E.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
It came from a house&mdash;81, Snow Hill&mdash;which had
formed part of a famous old galleried inn. Snow
Hill was the thoroughfare between Holborn and
the City, till in 1802 it was superseded by Skinner
Street, named after Alderman Skinner, which has
now in its turn ceased to exist. Snow Hill is
called in Stow’s ‘Survey’ Snor or Snore Hill,
and by Howell Sore Hill, perhaps from the steepness
and difficulty of the ascent. Strype, in 1720,
speaks of the George Inn as ‘very large and of a
considerable trade, the passage to the yard being
through Cow Lane.’ In Sampson’s ‘History of
Advertising,’ an advertisement is given from the
<i>British Chronicle</i> of January 18 to 20, 1762,
which informs us that</p>

<p class="p1">A second representation of the subject of the
George and Dragon was formerly to be seen on
Bennet Hill, opposite the Heralds’ College, and
stood over the entrance to a small court, to which
it gave a name. On it were the initials <span class="smcap">p r m</span>, and
date 1667. In ‘Remarks on London,’ by W. Stow,
1722, mention is made of ‘George Court, against
the Heralds’ Office at Paul’s Chain.’ The ‘Constitutions
of the Order of the Garter’ (c. iii.)
ordain that ‘the Sovereign shall put upon his (the
knight elect’s) neck a collar, or little chain or lace,
having pendant therefrom a massive golden image
of an armed knight (<i>i.e.</i>, St. George) sitting on
horseback.’</p>

<p>A relic of a most interesting old building is
the figure of Gerard the Giant,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> ‘carved from a
twisted block of timber, distorted and ill at ease,’
which stood in the niche between the first-floor
windows of Gerard’s Hall Hotel, on the
south side of Basing Lane. It is about 6 feet
high, and painted more or less to imitate life.
Gerard’s Hall is described by Stow as ‘one great
house, of old time built upon arched vaults, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
gates of stone from Caen in Normandy. The same
is now a common hostrey for receipt of travellers,
commonly and corruptly called Gerrardes Hall, of
a giant said to have dwelt there. In the high-roofed
hall of this house sometime stood a large
fir pole, which reached to the roof thereof, and
was said to be one of the staves that Gerrarde
the giant used in the wars to run withal.&mdash;John
Gisors, mayor of London in the year 1245, was
owner thereof, and Sir John Gisors, mayor and
constable of the Tower 1311, and divers others of
that name and family since that time, owned it.&mdash;So
it appeareth that this Gisor’s Hall, of late time
by corruption, hath been called Gerrard’s Hall.’
The upper part of the building was destroyed in
the Great Fire of 1666, but the crypt remained,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and on this was built a brick house, with no remarkable
feature except the above-named grotesque
wooden figure, by way of sign. This house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was destroyed in April, 1852, when the new
Cannon Street was being formed. For some
months the crypt&mdash;a fine specimen of thirteenth-century
Gothic&mdash;continued in existence; but as
the crown of the arched roof stood 2 feet or
more above the roadway, it was also pulled down.
Mr. Wheatley tells us that the stones were
carefully numbered, and presented to the Crystal
Palace Company, with a view to its re-erection.
After a time, however, they were used in making
the foundations for a new engine-house. Some of
the stones are even said to have found their way
to Kensington, to be broken up for mending the
roads. There is a good view of the crypt of
Gerard’s Hall in Burn’s ‘Catalogue to the Beaufoy
Trade Tokens,’ and a descriptive article in the
<i>Builder</i> for April 10, 1852, which also gives
drawings of several devices of the nature of
merchants’ marks, and an unfinished inscription,
cut on the wall of the entrance.</p>

<p>A curious sculptured sign, representing King
Charles I.’s gigantic porter and dwarf, used to
stand over the entrance to Bull Head Court,
Newgate Street, but disappeared some years ago
on the widening of King Edward Street, formerly
Butcher Hall Lane. This part of Newgate Street
was in Strype’s time named Blowbladder Street,
and before that Stinking Lane, on account of the
smell which arose from slaughter-houses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
poultry-shops there. Pennant has an illustration
of the sign, but wrongly describes it as being over
Bagnio Court, farther east, which was afterwards
Bath Street, and has now been ridiculously called
Roman Bath Street, though the ‘Royal Bagnio,’
whence the court derived its name, was not erected
till 1679. The house to which the bas-relief belonged
was No. 80, occupied in 1816 by Mr.
Payne, a hatter; at that time the figures were
painted, their coats being red, the King’s livery,
and their waistcoats white. Not unlikely, the
sign may still be in existence.</p>

<p>The two persons represented were William
Evans and Jefferey Hudson. Evans, the porter,
a Monmouth man, was 7 feet 6 inches high.
On one occasion, at a Court masque, he drew the
dwarf out of his pocket, ‘to the amazement
and amusement of all present.’ There is an
allusion to him in the contemporary ballad of
‘The Little Barleycorn.’ Jefferey Hudson, the
dwarf, was born at Oakham, Rutland, in 1619.
His father, a butcher, kept and baited bulls for
George Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham. At
nine years of age he was scarcely 18 inches high,
and, according to Fuller, ‘without any deformity,
wholly proportionable.’ Having entered the service
of the Duchess of Buckingham, at an entertainment
given by her husband to Charles I. and
Henrietta Maria, he was brought to table concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in a large pie, from which he emerged
before the company. The Queen took a fancy
to him, so he became her page, and in 1630
was sent to France to fetch a midwife for his royal
mistress, but fell into the hands of a Flemish pirate,
and was taken to Dunkirk. By this misfortune he
was said to have lost about £2,500. Sir William
Davenant makes a supposed combat between the
dwarf and a turkey-cock the subject of a burlesque
poem called ‘Jeffreidos,’ published in 1638, the
scene of which is laid at Dunkirk. How Hudson
bore the insult is not recorded; but we shall see
that he was quite capable of holding his own.
During the Civil Wars the dwarf appears to have
been a captain of horse, and he followed the
Queen into exile. One of his adventures in
France is referred to by Sir Walter Scott in
‘Peveril of the Peak.’ This was his duel with
Crofts, a young gentleman of the Court, who had
provoked him. The duel was fought on horseback
with pistols. Crofts came on the ground
armed with a syringe only; but a more serious
weapon being substituted, he was killed at the first
discharge. It seems to have been later that Hudson
was again taken prisoner at sea, this time by Turkish
pirates, and brought to Barbary, where he was
sold as a slave. He asserted that his sufferings in
captivity made him grow taller. After many
vicissitudes he found his way back to England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
probably before the year 1658. In 1679, being a
Roman Catholic, he was confined in the Gatehouse
at Westminster, for supposed complicity with the
Popish Plot. Mr. Inchbold points out, in the
‘Dictionary of National Biography,’ that he did
not die there, as Scott and others have affirmed;
for, ‘in June, 1680, and April, 1681, “Captain”
Jefferey Hudson received respectively £50 and
£20 from Charles II.’s secret service fund.’ He
died in 1682. Three portraits of him were
painted by Mytens, and he also figures in a
portrait of Queen Henrietta Maria, by Vandyke,
at Petworth. His waistcoat, breeches and stockings
are, it is said, preserved.</p>

<p>The sculptured stone sign of the Three Morris
Dancers was formerly in front of a public-house
numbered 36, Old Change, which is said to have
been pulled down about the year 1801. An illustration
of the sign exists: the central figure is a
woman. A seventeenth-century trade-token
issued from here reads thus:</p>

<p class="p1"><i>O.</i> <span class="smcap">iohn.lisle.at.the</span> = Three Morris Dancers.</p>
<p><i>R.</i> <span class="smcap">in.y<sup>e</sup> old.change</span> = I.A.L.</p>

<p class="p1">The word ‘morris’ is derived from the Spanish
‘morisco,’ and is equivalent to Moorish. The
Morris or Moorish pike was a weapon much
used in England in the reign of Henry VIII.;
Shakespeare refers to it in the ‘Comedy of Errors,’
Act iv., Scene 3. Elsewhere he uses the word in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
its commoner sense; thus, in ‘All’s Well that
Ends Well’ he speaks of a morris for May Day,
and in ‘King Henry V.,’ Act ii., Scene 4, the
Dauphin is made to say:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘And let us do it with no sign of fear;</p>
<p class="pp4">No, with no more than if we heard that England<br />
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance.’</p>

<p class="p1">According to Brand, the Spanish morris was
danced at puppet shows by a person habited like a
Moor. Strutt, in his ‘Sports and Pastimes of the
English People,’ connects it with the fandango.
Some curious dancing figures carved in wood once
formed part of the decorations in the mediæval
town-hall of Munich; the series was known as
the Maurscha tanntz. In England the dance
derived from the Moors seems to have been
grafted on to the rustic May games and sports,
which perhaps were falling into disuse. The
characters in the English morris-dance were
usually Maid Marian (a boy dressed up in girl’s
clothes), Robin Hood, Friar Tuck, the Fool, Tom
the piper with pipe and tabor, and the hobby-horse.
A rare pamphlet<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of 1609 tells us about
a morris-dance in Herefordshire, where the united
ages of the twelve dancers were supposed to amount
to twelve hundred years; but, unfortunately, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
does not give details of the performance. Waldron,
in his edition of the ‘Sad Shepherd,’ 1783,
p. 255, mentions seeing a company of morris-dancers
from Abington, at Richmond in Surrey,
in the summer of 1783. They appeared to be
making a kind of annual circuit. Even so late as
the time of the Queen’s coronation, there was
morris-dancing of a kind in Hyde Park, as recorded
by a writer in <i>Notes and Queries</i>.</p>

<p>One still sees occasionally on May Day, in the
less-frequented streets of London, a dance performed
by two or three sweeps to the sound of
fife and drum. They are dressed fantastically;
one of them is, as a rule, half concealed in a
frame covered with leaves and flowers, and is
called a Jack-in-the-green. They are generally
accompanied by a woman. These may be considered
to a certain extent descendants of the
morris-dancers, and their black faces happen to
carry out the old idea.</p>

<p>Over the doorway of No. 13, Clare Street, at
the corner of Vere Street, Clare Market, is a stone
sign carved in low relief, which represents Two
Negroes’ heads facing each other, with the date
1715 and initials <span class="smcap"><sub>w</sub><sup>s</sup><sub>m</sub></span>. The house is occupied
by a baker; its destruction is imminent, should
Government adopt the plan of the London
County Council for a new street from the Strand
to Holborn. The neighbourhood is now squalid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and many of the buildings have lately been cleared
away, but we know that in the seventeenth century
it was well inhabited. I may remark, as a curious
coincidence, that the continuation of Clare Street
towards Drury Lane is called Blackmoor&mdash;in old
maps Blackamore&mdash;Street. Seventeenth-century
trade-tokens with signs of negro heads are in
existence; one was issued from Drury Lane, and
is thus described by Boyne:</p>

<p class="p1"><i>O.</i> <span class="smcap">thomas.hayton.in.drvry</span> = A negro’s head.</p>
<p><i>R.</i> <span class="smcap">lane.his.halfe.penny</span> = An arched crown.</p>

<p class="p1">The following advertisement, which appeared in
a <i>London Gazette</i> for 1695, has a distinctly local
flavour:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘A Black boy, an Indian, about thirteen years old, run
away the 8th instant from Putney, with a collar about his
neck, with this inscription: “The Lady Bromfield’s black,
in Lincoln’s Inn Fields.”’</p>

<p class="p1">Black attendants were common in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. In more than one celebrated
portrait a black boy serves to enhance the
charm of a fair lady’s complexion. Sir John
Hawkins, after his voyage of 1564, which was
partly for slave-trading purposes, was authorized
to have as his crest the half-length figure of a
negro prisoner called heraldically a demi-Moor,
bound and captive. The Black Boy was a frequent
tobacconists’ sign, still sometimes seen.</p>

<p class="drop-cap16">AN interesting group of City signs is that connected
with the Three Kings, showing as
it does what a hold the sacred legend, handed
down to us from a remote past, continued to have
on popular imagination till comparatively recent
years. In the Guildhall Museum there is a stone
bas-relief of the Three Kings, brought from
No. 7, Bucklersbury when the house was rebuilt
some years ago. The figures are represented
standing in similar attitudes; they have sceptres
in their right hands, the left arm being in each
case folded across the breast. The figure to the
spectator’s left has flowing hair; that in the centre
is of negro type; the one to the right is distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
by a large moustache. A bas-relief from
Lambeth Hill, also in the Guildhall Museum, is
somewhat similar in design; the king on the left
has a crown, the others diadems; it is dated
1667. Another sign from Lambeth Hill&mdash;the
Three Crowns&mdash;was also put up in 1667, and
may possibly have belonged to the same house.</p>

</div>

<p>The sign of the Three Kings was an appropriate
one for inns, because on account of their
journey they were considered the patron saints of
travellers: it is also said to have been used in
England by mercers, because they imported fine
linen from Cologne. Bearing on this is a passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to be found among the Harleian manuscripts,
No. 5910, vol. i., fol. 193, which, though already
quoted by Larwood and Hotten in their ‘History
of Sign-boards,’ is so much to the point that I
venture to give it again:</p>

<p>‘Mersers in thouse dayes war Genirall Marchantes
and traded in all sortes of Rich Goodes,
besides those of scelckes [silks] as they do nou at
this day; but they brought into England fine
Leninn thered [linen thread] gurdeles [girdles]
finenly worked from Collin [Cologne]. Collin,
the city which then at that time of day florished
much and afforded rayre commodetes, and these
merchāts that vsually traded to that citye set vp
their singes ouer ther dores of ther Houses the
three kinges of Collin, with the Armes of that
Citye, which was the <span class="smcap">Three Crouens</span> of the
former kings in memorye of them, and by those
singes the people knew in what wares they deld
in.’</p>

<p>This was written by Bagford, the antiquary and
‘biblioclast,’ whose spelling was original, to say
the least.</p>

<p>Innumerable traditions, myths, and allegories,
have by degrees been grafted on to the brief
Gospel narrative of the Three Magi; St. Matthew,
the only Evangelist who mentions them,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> gives no
authority for fixing their number at three, nor for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
assigning to them a higher rank than that of Magi,
or disciples of Zoroaster; but we may with reason
hold that they are referred to in Ps. lxxii. 10, 11:
‘The Kings of Tharsis and of the Isles shall give
presents, the Kings of Arabia and Saba shall bring
gifts.’ This passage is recited in the Roman
Catholic offices of the Epiphany, and on it no
doubt is founded their claim to kingly rank. It
has been generally said that to Leo the Great, or
to St. Maximus of Turin, may be ascribed the
traditional number; Dr. Northcote,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> however,
considers that Origen, who was born at Alexandria,
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 185, had the same idea. St. Augustine
taught that they were three in number, from the
three kinds of gifts that they offered&mdash;gold, frankincense,
and myrrh.</p>

<p>Few subjects have been oftener treated in
Christian art than that of these astronomer kings
who, guided by a star from the East, came to
worship the infant Saviour at Bethlehem. The
early Christians painted the scene, but, following
literally the words of St. Matthew, they
varied their number, and showed no signs of
royalty. De Rossi in his ‘Roma Sotteranea,’
speaks of upwards of twenty representations
of the subject in the Catacombs. The Virgin
Mother is, in these paintings, generally represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
sitting at the side, with the Child in
her lap and the three Magi before her, but
sometimes she is in the middle; and here, in
order, perhaps, to keep the balance of the composition,
the number of Magi is either increased or
diminished; there are four, as in the cemetery of
St. Domitilla, or only two, as in that of SS. Peter
and Marcellinus. In <i>Harper’s New Monthly
Magazine</i> for January, 1888, an illustration is
given of this latter painting.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The two Magi
approach from either side; they are plainly
dressed with short tunics, cloaks, and Phrygian
caps, and bear their gifts on golden trays or
dishes. De Rossi assigns it to the second half of
the third century; that of St. Domitilla is supposed
to be somewhat earlier.</p>

<p>Let us see how the subject was treated in early
mosaics. A very famous one is that in the
Basilica of S. Maria Maggiore at Rome, dating,
it seems, from about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 432-440. Here the
Child sits alone on a large chair or pedestal, His
hand raised in benediction; a nimbus surmounted
by a cross marks His divine origin. The mosaic
is said to have been altered in the time of Pope
Benedict XIV.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>; the Magi would appear to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
been originally three in number, and without the
insignia of royalty. In the great mosaic of St.
Apollinare Nuovo at Ravenna, they approach
with measured steps, and bending in attitudes of
reverence: on their heads were crowns, since exchanged
for baronial caps. The Virgin sits enthroned
in state, the Child on her lap; two angels
on either side attend them. According to the
‘Liber Pontificalis’ of Ravenna, this work was executed
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 553-556, under the direction of Bishop
Agnellus.</p>

<p>The legend as it has come down to us gradually
assumed concrete form. Our first detailed account
of the appearance of the Three Kings is from the
pen of a Western writer&mdash;the Venerable Bede&mdash;who
founded it, probably, on reports from Italy or
the East. In his treatise ‘De Collectaneis,’ he names
and describes them thus:<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> ‘The first is said to
have been called Melchior, an old man gray-headed,
with flowing beard and locks; he presented gold
to the Lord, the King. Gaspar, the second, was
young, beardless, and ruddy; he with frankincense,
as an oblation worthy of God, honoured God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
The third, by name Baltassar, was dark-complexioned,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and had a full beard; he by means of
myrrh signified that the Son of Man should die.’
He then describes their dresses.</p>

<p>It has been said<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that this account may probably
be traced to early quasi-dramatic representations.
‘In any such performance, names of some kind
would become a matter of necessity, and were
probably invented at random.’ Though the
names given in the above passage are those with
which we are familiar, many others have, perhaps
with equal authority, been applied to them.</p>

<p>The nationality of the Three Kings has been as
much discussed as the time taken on their journey.
The natural inference would appear to be that
they belonged to the priestly caste of Persia;
Cornelius à Lapide considers that they were
Eastern Arabians. He says: ‘The more common
opinion of the Fathers and Doctors is that the
Magi came on the thirteenth day from the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
appearance of the star and the birth of Christ,
whence the Church celebrates the mystery on the
twelfth day after Christmas.’<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In their old age
they were said to have been baptized by St.
Thomas, and to have associated with him in
preaching the Gospel. Lastly, some have asserted
that they were slain by idolaters; L. Dexter in
his chronicle, under <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 70, adds: ‘In Arabia
Felix, in the City of Sessania, took place the
martyrdom of the three royal Magi; Gaspar,
Balthazar, Melchior.’</p>

<p>We are told that early in the fourth century
their bodies were discovered, and moved to
Constantinople by the pious Empress Helena.
Thence they found their way to Milan, being
enshrined in the church of San Eustorgio. A few
years later their fame was increased by the institution
of the Feast of the Three Kings, which
has been ascribed to Pope Julius, the first of
that name. After the taking of Milan<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, in the year 1162,
the precious relics were granted to Reinaldus,
Archbishop of Cologne, who brought them to that
city, which proved to be their final resting-place.
Cologne, proud of the honour, adopted as her arms,
argent, on a chief gules, three royal crowns or;
and so we have an interesting heraldic record of
this event.</p>

<p>In course of time, however, each of these Three
Kings<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> has had a shield of arms assigned to him.
Perhaps the earliest examples yet known are on the
roof of Norwich Cathedral. Here we find three
bosses which date from the time of Bishop Lehart,
who ruled that see from 1446 to 1472; on one is
a blazing star, the next has seven stars, the third
a star and crescent moon. The first and last
of these appear on bosses at Winchester, placed
there in the days of Richard Foxe, successively
Bishop of Exeter, Durham and Winchester, and
founder of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He
also gave relics of the three Epiphany Kings to
Portchester Old Church.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Lord Ashburnham’s
picture of the Adoration, exhibited at Burlington
House in 1891, may be considered one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
most noteworthy examples illustrating this branch
of the subject. It is attributed to Mabuse,
and in Mr. Weale’s opinion was evidently painted
about the year 1509, under strong Franciscan
influence. In it are three processions in the background,
of the Three Kings meeting at the Jordan.
Each procession has an azure banner; on one is a
blazing star, on another seven stars, and on the
third a star and crescent moon. These same
charges are embroidered on their robes in the
foreground of the picture, and as on two of the
Kings the names of Jasper<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and Balthazar appear,
we see that the star and crescent are assigned
to Jasper, the blazing star to Balthazar, and the
seven stars to Melchior. Different versions of
the arms exist; for instance, those in a manuscript
book of heraldry, which Sir David Lyndsay of the
Mount, Lyon King of Arms in Scotland, caused
to be executed in the year 1522, and of which
Mr. David Laing published a facsimile in 1878.
Here Balthazar is called King of Saba, whose
assigned shield of arms is, or, on a mount vert an
Ethiopian proper, habited in a tunic per pale,
azure and gules, holding in the dexter hand
a spear with a pennon per pale, gules and azure,
and wreathed round the temples, argent and azure.
Jasper is called King of Tarshish; his shield is
azure, with an estoile on the dexter, and a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
crescent moon on the sinister, both proper. Melchior
is called King of Araby, and on his azure
shield are six estoiles proper. In the British
Museum, on a superb jug of stoneware, made at
Raaren near Achen, about 1590, are the three
shields of arms of the Three Kings of Cologne.
On this jug, Balthazar has the star and crescent
moon; Casper, as he is here called, the seven
stars; and the Ethiopian is assigned to Melchior.
A work of art truly delightful, but conveying no
heraldic lesson, is the long fresco of the journey
of the Three Kings by Bennozzo Gozzoli, in the
Riccardi Palace at Florence, wherein the rich cavalcade
is shown, winding about by rock and river
and wooded landscape, on which the painter has
lavished all his poetry of invention and feeling for
fresh nature.</p>

<p>In England the story of the Three Kings was
often introduced into plays and pageants.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In the
ninth report Hist. MSS. Com., Part I., is a full
description, dated 1501, of a pageant given at the
Guildhall, entitled ‘The 3 Kyngs of Coleyn.’ It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
seems that managers of sacred plays were fined if
they failed to give satisfaction, for in the records
of the town of Beverley, under the year 1519,
occurs the following entry: ‘Also 2s. received
of Richard Trollop, Alderman of the Painters,
because his play of the Three Kings of Cologne
was badly and disorderly performed.’ Mr. Thomas
Wright, F.S.A., in his edition of the Chester
Mysteries, shows that they took place on Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday of Whitsun week. To
each City company was assigned a play, twenty-four
in all; to the Vintners the journey of the Three
Kings, and to the Mercers their offerings and return.</p>

<p>The lives of the Three Kings were printed by
Tresyrel in Paris in 1498, and by Wynkyn de
Worde in 1516. The gifts of these Kings were
recorded in the following Latin verses, which, if
written with blood from the little finger of a
person troubled with falling sickness, and hung
about the neck, were according to an old book&mdash;‘The
Myrrhour of a Glasse of Healthe’&mdash;an infallible
cure; it will be observed that they do not
quite agree with the description given by the
Venerable Bede:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1"> ‘Jaspar fert myrrham, thus Melchior, Balthazur aurum,<br />
Hæc tria, qui secum portabit nomina regum,<br />
Solvitur à morbo, Christi pietate, caduco.’ </p>

<p class="p1">A mediæval ring was found some time ago at
Dunwich, whereon the above lines were inscribed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
it is figured in Fairholt’s ‘Rambles of an Archæologist,’
1871. In 1794 Mr. Craven Ord, F.S.A.,
described a bas-relief of alabaster, in the church of
Long Melford, Suffolk, representing the offerings
of the Magi. It still exists in good condition; an
illustration of it appeared as frontispiece to a monograph
on the church printed in 1887. Another
interesting memento was a leaden box found in the
Thames, and drawn for Mr. Roach Smith’s ‘Collectanea
Antiqua,’ i. 115; on which, in six compartments,
are delineated the story of the Salutation
of the Virgin and the offerings of the Three Kings.</p>

<p>In the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for February,
1749, vol. xix., p. 88, it is stated that the following
prayer for protection was found in the
linen purse of William Jackson a smuggler, who
had been condemned to death for taking part in
the murder of Galley and Chater, two Custom-house
officers, but was so struck with horror on
being measured for his irons that he died (a
Roman Catholic) in Chichester Gaol a few hours
after the sentence was pronounced upon him:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Sancti tres Reges,</p>
<p class="pp4">Gaspar Melchior Balthazar,<br />
Orate pro nobis nunc et in hora</p>
<p class="pp8">Mortis nostræ.</p>

<p class="pbqn p1">Ces billets ont touché aux trois testes de SS. Roys à Cologne.
Ils sont pour les voyageurs contre les malheurs de chemins,
maux de teste, mal caduque, fievres, forçellerie, toute sorte de
malefiee, mort subite.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">This paper had a rude illustration: Mr. Roach
Smith gives a copy of it from a drawing by Fairholt.
A similar prayer is still distributed at the
shrine of the Three Kings.</p>

<p>Throughout Christendom the feast of the
Epiphany, or Twelfth Day, holds an honoured
place, as commemorating the appearance or manifestation
of Christ to the Gentiles, more especially
to the Kings or Wise Men, who came from the
East to do Him homage. In Spain it is called
Fiesta de los Reyes, in France La Fête de Rois.
In the year 1792 it was there pronounced an anti-civic
feast which made every priest that kept it a
Royalist, and the name was for a time changed to
Fête de Sans-Culottes.</p>

<p>It is hard to say whether the sign of the
Seven Stars had its origin from the shield of
an Astronomer King, Gaspar or Melchior, or
from the seven bright stars of the constellation
usually called the Great Bear,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> or whether it
was suggested by the mystic pages of the
Apocalypse; but from whatever source derived, it
was common in London about the time of the
Great Fire. A fine sculptured specimen with
ornamental border was to be seen in Cheapside as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
late as the year 1851, when Archer drew it. A
cognate sign was the Sun,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> a stone carving of
which was formerly imbedded in the front of a
house in the Poultry. It had at the corners the
date 1668. The neighbourhood was at one time
rich in astronomical signs. In 1532 Richard
Collier, citizen and mercer of London, left his
messuage called the Sun, in the parish of St. Mary
le Bow, to be sold, and the proceeds to be devoted
to the founding of a free school at Horsham in
Sussex, which still exists, and is in the hands of
the Mercers’ Company. Other signs of this
description in Cheapside, were the Star, the Man
in the Moon, and the Half-Moon&mdash;the sign of a
celebrated tavern on the north side, close to Gutter
Lane, rebuilt after the Great Fire. Here in 1682
Elias Ashmole presided at a dinner, given at the
charge of newly accepted Freemasons; and, from
a rare print of the early part of the eighteenth
century, it seems that here one of their lodges was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
held. The following appeared in the <i>General
Advertiser</i> in 1748:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘<span class="smcap">Half-Moon Tavern, Cheapside.</span>&mdash;Saturday next, the
16 April, being the anniversary of the Glorious Battle of
Culloden, the Stars will assemble in the Moon, at six in the
evening. Therefore, the choice spirits are desired to make
their appearance and to fill up the joy.’</p>

<p class="p1">The house belonged to the Saddlers’ Company,
and was burnt down in 1821; No. 140 is said to
occupy the site.</p>

</div>

<p>A sculptured bas-relief of a Half-Moon still
appears to the left of a doorway, on the north
side of the Half-Moon Inn Yard, Borough High
Street. It is about four feet from the ground
and has on it the initials <span class="smcap">i t e</span>, with date 1690;
the size is only 13 by 10-1/2 inches. This, as far as
I know, is the only inn sign of the kind in
London which still remains in its original position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and retains its use. The Half-Moon, though not
one of the most famous Southwark hostelries, has
a record of its own worth alluding to. In a
rough map of about the year 1542, now in the
Record Office, an inn appears to be marked on
this site, but the name cannot clearly be made out.
The great Southwark fire of 1676 did not extend
so far east. The first undoubted note I have of
it, is contained in a broadsheet printed at Fleet
Bridge, September, 1689, and now in the Guildhall
Library, entitled ‘A Full and True Account
of the Sad and Dreadful Fire that happened in
Southwark, September 22, 1689;’ from which we
learn that houses were blown up, and the Falcon
and Half-Moon on opposite sides of the High
Street were on fire at the same time. Our sign
gives the date of rebuilding in the following year,
and the initials of the owner or landlord. In
1720 Strype speaks of the Half-Moon as ‘a
pretty large inn and of a good trade.’ It was then
in the thick of Southwark Fair, and is alluded to
in the following advertisement (September, 1729):</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘At Reynolds’ Great Theatrical Booth, in the Half-Moon
Inn, near the Bowling Green, during the Fair, will be presented
the Beggar’s Wedding, or the Sheep Shearing, an
opera called Flora, and the Humours of Harlequin.’</p>

<p class="p1">Hogarth introduced a hanging sign of the Half-Moon
into his celebrated picture of Southwark
Fair, which represents the High Street looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
towards old St. George’s Church, just before its
demolition. The foundation-stone of the present
church was laid April 23, 1734, this picture
having been painted in the previous year. In a
quaint little book of 1815, called the ‘Epicure’s
Almanack,’ the Half-Moon is described as ‘a large
establishment; its convenient accommodations for
entertaining and lodging guests extend on either
side the inn yard, and are connected by a well-contrived
bridge from gallery to gallery,’ which
still exists.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Browne was of opinion that the
human face on alehouse signs, on coats of arms,
etc., for the sun and moon, are relics of paganism,
and that their visages originally implied Apollo
and Diana. Butler in ‘Hudibras’ asks a shrewd
question, as yet not effectually answered:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Tell me but what’s the nat’ral cause<br />
Why on a sign no painter draws<br />
The full moon ever, but the half?’</p>

<p class="p1">The crescent moon, as we have seen, appears
among the armorial bearings of the Three Kings
of Cologne. It was also a badge of the Percy
family; Drayton in his ‘Barons’ Wars’ alludes to
one of them thus:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘The noble Piercy, in this dreedful day,<br />
With a bright crescent in his guidon came.’</p>

<p class="pn1">Retainers of the Percies no doubt often adopted
it as a sign on this account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Burn, a mark shaped like a half-moon
represented sixpence in the alewife’s uncancelled
score. He points out that in ‘Master
W. H., his Song to his Wife at Windsor,’ printed
in Captain Llewellyn’s ‘Men-miracles, and other
Poems,’ 1656, duod., p. 40, mention is made of
‘the fat harlot of the tap,’ who</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Writes at night and at noon,<br />
For tester, half a moon;<br />
And great round O, for a shilling.’</p>

<p class="p1">The woodcut attached to the ballad of ‘My
Wife will be my Master,’ printed in J. P. Collier’s
‘Booke of Roxburghe Ballads,’ 1847, p. 89,
clearly indicates such an alewife’s score.</p>

<p>Before I leave this branch of my subject, it will
be well to call attention to the Half-Moon sign
which projects over a shop numbered 36, about
half-way up Holywell Street on the south side.
This is the last&mdash;still <i>in situ</i>&mdash;of another class of
London house-signs, and will doubtless soon be
swept away together with the picturesque old
street to which it belongs. The material is wood,
boldly carved and gilt, with the conventional face
in the centre. One of the horns was damaged,
but has lately been repaired. Diprose<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> says it was
once the sign of a tradesman who was staymaker
to George III. About forty years ago the shop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
was occupied by a mercer, and the bills made
out for the customers were adorned with this sign:
since then it has been a bookseller’s.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The corner-post of an alley beside it, leading into
the Strand, used formerly to be decorated with a
carved lion’s head and paws, painted red, and acting
as a corbel to support the old timbered house to
which it belonged. This may have been associated
with the neighbouring Lyons Inn, once a hostelry
with the sign of the Lion, demolished about twenty-five
years ago, and the site of which is occupied
by the Globe and Opera Comique Theatres. The
alley remains, and is now called, after the sign,
Half-Moon Passage, but might still be described
by the unsavoury name given to it in the old
maps, as Strype says, ‘in contempt.’ The old house
disappeared not long since, and the lion has found
a home in the Guildhall Museum.</p>

<p class="pr12"><span class="smcap">Drayton</span>: <i>Barons’ Wars</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap08">ONE or two of the signs to be dealt with
under this heading are purely heraldic;
others are allied to nature, and have, as far I am
aware, no connection with heraldry. The stone
carving of an ape seated on its haunches and eating
an apple belonged to this class; it had on it the
initials <span class="smcap">b m</span> with date 1670, and some years ago was
to be seen built into a wall on the west side of
Philip Lane, exactly opposite the Ward School of
Cripplegate Within. The space at the back was
occupied by a court, the whole being now
swallowed up in the premises of Messrs. Rylands
and Sons. This marked the site of an ancient
galleried inn of which it had been the sign. A
similar piece of sculpture is or was lately in a
street called the Sporrengasse at Basle. A little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
further east in Philip Lane a modern sculptured
cock commemorates Cock Court, now destroyed,
where another ancient inn had once stood. Drawings
of both are preserved in the British Museum.</p>

<p>Not far from Philip Lane, at 17a, Addle Street,
there is a fine bas-relief of a bear with collar and
chain; it is above the first-floor window of a house
rebuilt about twelve years ago, and has on it the
initials <span class="smcap">n t e</span> and date 1670&mdash;not 1610, as we are
told by Archer. Munday and Dyson, in the fourth
edition of Stow’s ‘Survey’ (1633), assert that Addle
Street derived its name from Athlestane or Adlestane,
whose house was supposed to have been hard
by, in Wood Street, with a door into Addle Street.</p>

<p>An interesting sculptured sign of a Bear was
dug up in 1882, when the house numbered 47,
on the south side of Cheapside, was being rebuilt.
It was found in a damaged state 7 or 8 feet
below the surface, and is now let into the wall
inside the shop of Messrs. Cow and Co., india-rubber
manufacturers. An old arched cellar or
undercroft of considerable height still exists in the
basement, and extends to a distance of some 30
feet below the street. This sign, which represents
a bear chained and muzzled,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and in heraldic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
language <i>contourné</i>, or facing to the right instead
of the left, has neither date nor initials. A
suggestion has been made that this is the White
Bear, the sign of Robert Hicks, a mercer at Soper’s
Lane end, and father of Sir Baptist Hicks, born
there in 1551, who built Hicks Hall<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and who,
says Strype, was one of the first citizens that after
knighthood kept their shops (eventually he became
Lord Campden). This, however, is by no means
probable; the sign resembles others put up after
the Great Fire; moreover, Soper’s Lane, now
Queen Street, is some distance east of St. Mary-le-Bow
Church, while No. 47 is to the west, near
Bread Street. On the opposite side of the way
was a house with a similar sign, as appears from
the following advertisement in the <i>London Gazette</i>
of October 5, 1693:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘Lost from the Brown Bear, next door to Mercers’ Chapel,
in Cheapside, a large broken silver candlestick, having on
the bottom James Morris engraven; also two double silver
scroles of sconces, and a small scrole of a silver sconce, &amp;c.’</p>

<p class="p1">Yet another sculptured sign of a chained bear
exists in the City, more or less in its former
position. It has on it the initials M E with date
1670, and is to be found let into a modern wall
at the entrance to Messrs. Cox and Hammond’s
quays, between Nos. 5 and 6, Lower Thames
Street, having fortunately escaped a fire which in
part destroyed the premises some years since.
A far more terrible fire occurred in the neighbourhood
in January, 1714-15, when above 120
houses were said to have been either burnt or
blown up, and many persons perished. It was
caused by an explosion in a little gunpowder shop
near Bear Quay, and burned eastward as far as
Mark Lane. The sign belonged perhaps originally
to this Bear Quay, the site of which is now
covered by the Custom House, and which in the
eighteenth century was chiefly appropriated to the
landing and shipment of wheat.</p>

<p>A Great Bear Quay and a Little Bear Quay
are marked close together in Strype’s map of the
Tower Ward. Beer Lane, further east, leading
from Great Tower Street to Lower Thames Street,
was in Stow’s time called Beare Lane. From a
writ dated at Windsor, October 30, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
thirtieth year of Henry III., it appears that the
Sheriffs of London were commanded to provide
a muzzle, an iron chain, and a cord, for the King’s
white bear in the Tower of London, and to use
him to catch fish in the water of the Thames; and
six years afterwards, namely in 1252, the Sheriffs
were commanded to supply fourpence per diem
for the maintenance of the King’s white bear and
his keeper in the Tower. Burnet tells us that
on May 29, 1542, the French Ambassadors, after
they had supped with the Duke of Somerset, went
to the Thames, and saw the bear hunted in the
river. Anne, daughter of the Earl of Warwick,
and consort of Richard III., adopted the white
bear as a badge. In 1539 a ‘Manual of Prayers’
was printed by John Mayler, at the sign of the
White Bear in Botolph Lane. A seventeenth-century
trade token was issued by a grocer from
the sign of the White Bear, Thames Street.
Another trade token, ascribed by Boyne and
others to Southwark, is far more likely to have
been issued from here; it reads thus:</p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>O.</i> <span class="smcap">philip stower.at</span> = a bear.<br />
<i>R.</i> <span class="smcap">the.beare.at.bare.key</span> = <span class="smcap">p.s.s.</span></p>

<p class="p1">A curious stone bas-relief of Bel and the
Dragon is preserved by Messrs. Corbyn and Co.,
the eminent chemists, at No. 7, Poultry, being let
into the wall of a back room; the idol is represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
by an actual bell. Larwood and Hotten
say that the sign was not uncommon, especially
among apothecaries; it is alluded to in the
<i>Spectator</i>, No. 28. At Messrs. Corbyn’s there
is also a very handsome mortar of bell-metal, said
to have been used by the firm in early days, with
an inscription in Flemish or old German, and the
date 1536. Messrs. Corbyn have had a copy of
the above sign inserted in the wall of their new
establishment, at the corner of Bond Street and
Oxford Street; it came originally from their old
house of business in Holborn.</p>

<p>The stone sign of the house which succeeded
the Shakespearean Boar’s Head has happily been
preserved, and is now in the Guildhall Museum.
It is well designed and tastefully coloured, that
fact having come to light when a thorough process
of cleansing took place some time since. Above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the snout are the initials <span class="smcap">i. t.</span>, and date 1668;
size 18-1/2 by 16 inches. The Boar’s Head tavern
will be famous for all time, as the scene of the
revelries of Falstaff and Prince Hal; how far it
was really connected with Shakespeare’s immortal
creation has been discussed at length by the late Mr.
Halliwell Phillipps. In the time of Henry V.,
Eastcheap was noted for its cooks’ shops, as appears
from the ballad of London Lickpenny, by
John Lydgate, monk at Bury St. Edmunds, in
which, while giving a countryman’s description of
London, he says:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Then I hyed me into Est-Chepe;<br />
One cryes rybbs of befe, and many a pye;<br />
Pewter pottes they clattered on a heape.<br />
There was harpe, pype, and minstralsye.<br />
Yea, by cock! nay, by cock! some began crye;<br />
Some songe of Jenken and Julyan for there mede;<br />
But for lack of mony I myght not spede.’</p>

<p class="p1">Stow, mentioning an affray in which King Henry
IV.’s sons Thomas and John were concerned,
adds in a note, ‘there was no taverne then in Eastcheape.’</p>

<p>Curiously enough, there is also no distinct
authority in any of the early editions of Shakespeare’s
plays for the name of the tavern in Eastcheap
at which Falstaff and the Prince are supposed
to meet. Theobald was the first, in 1733, to place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the Boar’s Head in the stage directions. Shakespeare
never mentions it at all, and his only
apparent allusion is in the second part of
‘Henry the Fourth,’ where the Prince asks
(speaking of Falstaff): ‘Doth the old boar feed
in the old frank?’ and Bardolph answers: ‘At the
old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.’ A suggestion
of the house may also possibly be intended in
‘Richard the Second,’ where the Prince is mentioned
as frequenting taverns ‘that stand in narrow
lanes.’ In the play of the ‘Famous Victories of
Henry the Fifth,’ 1594, on which Shakespeare’s
drama was partly founded, the Castle tavern is
mentioned as the place of meeting in Eastcheap.
An allusion, however, to ‘Sir John of the Boar’s
Head in Eastcheap,’ in Gayton’s ‘Festivous
Notes’ (1654, p. 277), may be considered to prove
that this was, in truth, the tavern to which Shakespeare
referred. His contemporary, Dekker, in
the play of ‘The Shoemakers’ Holyday, or, The
Gentle Craft,’ has the following: <i>Eyre</i>. ‘Rip you
chitterling, avaunt, boy; bid the tapster of the
Bores-head fill me a doozen cans of beere for my
journeymen.’</p>

<p>The earliest notice of the original house which
has been handed down to us occurs in the testament
of William Warden, who, in the reign of
Richard II., gave all his tenement called the
Boar’s Head, in Eastcheap, to a college of priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
or chaplains, founded by Sir William Walworth,
Lord Mayor, in the adjoining Church of St.
Michael, Crooked Lane. The endowments of
this college were forfeited in the year 1549, when
the house above alluded to is described as all the
said William Warden’s tenement called the Boar’s
Head, Eastcheap, ‘worth by year £4.’</p>

<p>The Boar’s Head is first called a tavern in the
year 1537, when it is expressly described in a
lease, as ‘all that tavern called the Bore Hedde,
cum sollariis et aliis suis pertinentiis in Estchepe,
in parochia Sancti Michaelis, prædicti in tenura
Johanne Broke vidue.’ An apparently genuine
memento was discovered about the year 1834
in moving away soil from Whitechapel Mount.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
It is a carved boxwood bas-relief of a boar’s
head set in a circular frame formed by two
boar’s tusks mounted in silver; diameter, 4½<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
inches. An inscription pricked on the back is as
follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘William Brooke Landlord of the Bores Hedde Estchepe
1566.’</p>

<p class="pn1">This now belongs to Lady Burdett Coutts, and
was shown two years ago at the Tudor Exhibition.
In the year 1588, the inn was kept by Thomas
Wright, a native of Shrewsbury: ‘Thear was
chosen with me at that time out of the school,
George Wrighte, son of Thomas Wrighte of
London, vintener, that dwelt at the Bores Hed in
Estcheap, who sithence, having good inheritance
descended to him, is now clerk of the king’s stable,
and a knight, a very discreet and honest gentleman;’
as we learn from the ‘Liber Famelicus’
of Sir John Whitelocke, edited by J. Bruce (p. 12).
On March 31, 1602, the Lords of the Council
wrote to the Lord Mayor, granting permission to
the servants of the Earl of Oxford and the Earl of
Worcester to play at the Boar’s Head in Eastcheap:<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
which seems to indicate that the house was
an important one, probably with a yard. In the
year 1623, ‘John Rhodoway, vintner at the Bore’s
Head,’ was buried at St. Michael’s, Crooked Lane.
This person may have kept the tavern in Shakespeare’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
time. Two seventeenth-century trade
tokens were issued from ‘the Bore’s Head, neere
London Stone,’ as it is called in the rare tract
called ‘Newes from Bartholomew Fayre.’ These
tokens are undated, but it seems likely that they
were struck before 1666. One of them gives the
name of John Sapcott as the landlord.</p>

<p>The Boar’s Head tavern was burnt in the Great
Fire, and rebuilt of brick four stories high, with
its door in the centre. Many allusions to this
second Boar’s Head have been preserved; one of
the quaintest was an inscription on a tombstone
in the neighbouring churchyard of St. Michael’s,
Crooked Lane, which I lately saw at the back of
St. Magnus Church, whither it migrated when its
first resting-place was covered by the approaches
to new London Bridge. The epitaph runs thus:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘Here lieth the bodye of Robert Preston, late drawer at
the Boar’s Head Tavern Great Eastcheap who departed this
life March 16 Anno Domini 1730, aged twenty-seven years.’</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Bacchus to give the toping world surprise,<br />
Produc’d one sober son, and here he lies.<br />
Tho’ nurs’d among full hogsheads, he defyd<br />
The charm of wine, and every vice beside.<br />
O reader, if to justice thou’rt inclined,<br />
Keep honest Preston daily in thy mind.<br />
He drew good wine, took care to fill his pots,<br />
Had sundry virtues that outweighed his fauts (<i>sic</i>).<br />
You that on Bacchus have the like dependence,<br />
Pray copy Bob in measure and attendance.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">In the second edition of Maitland’s ‘London,’
1756, we are told that under the sign of the
Boar’s Head, the following inscription was then to
be seen: ‘This is the oldest tavern in London.’
Goldsmith was there in 1758, getting material
for his charming ‘Reverie at the Boar’s Head,’
in which, however, he assumed that he was in the
actual tavern immortalized by Shakespeare; and
in 1818 another gifted author&mdash;Washington Irving&mdash;after
a similar visit, wrote an essay as charming
and as inaccurate. During their tour to the
Hebrides in 1773, Boswell mentioned to Dr.
Johnson a club held at the Boar’s Head, the
members of which all assumed Shakespearean
characters, one was Falstaff, another Prince Hal,
another Bardolph, and so on. Johnson’s remark
on the occasion was: ‘Don’t be of it, sir. Now
that you have a name you must be careful to avoid
many things, not bad in themselves, but which
will lessen your character.’ Scruples of this kind
do not seem to have troubled the great William Pitt,
at any rate when he was young. In the ‘Life of
William Wilberforce,’<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> by his son, the following
anecdote is told by the philanthropist: ‘I was one
of those who met to spend an evening in memory
of Shakespeare at the Boar’s Head, Eastcheap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Many professed wits were present, but Pitt was
the most amusing of the party, and the most apt
at the required allusions.’ This social gathering
took place in the year 1780.</p>

<p>An interesting addition has lately been made to
the Guildhall Museum, a bequest of the late Dr.
Burgon, Dean of Chichester. It is a water-colour
drawing of a figure from the house in Eastcheap,
supposed to represent Falstaff, but so lean that it
by no means embodies the idea contained in his
words to the Lord Chief Justice: ‘I would that
my means were greater, and my waist slenderer.’
The costume seems to be of the sixteenth century.
This was copied no doubt from the figure carved
in oak, 12 inches high, which was exhibited by
Mr. Kempe to the Society of Antiquaries in
December, 1833, and which once decorated the
portal of the tavern. The figure had supported an
ornamental bracket over one side of the door, a
corresponding figure of Prince Henry sustaining
that on the other. It was at that time the
property of Mr. Thomas Shelton, brazier, Great
Eastcheap, whose ancestors had lived in the shop
he occupied since the time of the Great Fire.
He well remembered the last grand dinner-party,
which had taken place at the Boar’s Head about
fifty years before. The guests came from the
west end of the town, and the long string of
carriages which conveyed them filled the street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
at Eastcheap. Hutton, writing in 1785, gives a
somewhat different account of the figures. He
says,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> ‘On each side of the entrance to the Boar’s
Head there is a vine branch carved in wood rising
more than three feet from the ground, loaded
with leaves and clusters, and on the top of each a
little Falstaff eight inches high, in the dress of
his day.’</p>

<p>Peter Cunningham says that the Boar’s Head
stood in Great Eastcheap, between Small Alley
and St. Michael’s Lane, four taverns filling up the
intervening space&mdash;the Chicken, near St. Michael’s
Alley, the Boar’s Head, the Plough, and the
Three Kings. The statue of King William IV.
is considered to be a few feet east of the site.
The house had ceased to be a tavern before
Pennant wrote in 1790. It was divided into two
tenements, and became Nos. 2 and 3, Great Eastcheap.
Part was occupied by a gunsmith, when
in June, 1831, the building, having been bought
by the Corporation for £3,544, was immediately
pulled down to make room for the approaches of
new London Bridge. It is a curious fact that, on
the opposite side of the river, at about an equal
distance, stood another famous old Boar’s Head
Inn, the site of which is also now covered by the
approaches to London Bridge, and this had without
doubt once belonged to that notable man, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
John Fastolfe,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> who must at least have furnished
the name to Shakespeare’s matchless creation.
The back part of the City inn looked upon the
burial-ground of St. Michael’s, Crooked Lane, as
did the other on the Flemish burial-ground in
Southwark. Of this latter and of the man who
owned it, a rather full account is given in the
‘Inns of Old Southwark and their Associations,’
by Rendle and Norman.</p>

<p>From J. T. Smith and others I learn that in the
early part of this century, not far from the Boar’s
Head in Eastcheap, and nearly facing Miles Lane,
there was a bold and animated figure of a Mermaid
carved in relief, with her dishevelled hair
about her shoulders, and holding in her right hand
something resembling ‘a bundle of flax or a distaff’;
more likely a looking-glass. I mention the
sign here for the sake of convenience, though I
own its classification is a difficulty, one writer
placing it with human signs, and another with
‘fishes and insects.’ There still exists a Mermaid
carved in relief at No. 21, East Street, Gravesend.
The material seems to be cut brick or terra-cotta;
it has an ornamental border with cleft pediment.
Seafaring people are always more or less attracted
by the supernatural, and so the sign has been a
favourite one here and in Holland, where also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
merman, with helmet, sword, and buckler, was not
uncommon. A merman and a mermaid are supporters
of the arms of the Fishmongers’ Company,
a fine carving of which is to be seen at the back
of their present hall. The badge of the Byrons
was a mermaid argent, crined and finned or, holding
in the left hand a comb, in the right a mirror.
It is recorded by Strype that ‘Boniface Tatam of
London, vintner, buried in the parish of St. Peter’s
Cornhill on the 3rd Feb., 1606, gave 40s. yearly
to the parson for preaching 4 sermons every year
so long as the Mermaid, a tavern in Cornhill so
called, shall endure.’ But the most famous Mermaid,
perhaps the most famous of all Elizabethan
taverns, was that in Bread Street, Friday Street,
and Cheapside, for they were all one and the same&mdash;the
house standing back from Bread Street, with
passage entrances from Cheapside and Friday
Street.</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Souls of poets dead and gone,<br />
What Elysium have ye known,<br />
Happy field or mossy cavern,<br />
Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern?’</p>

<p class="p1">Another famous hostelry in old days was the
Bull, Bishopsgate Street Within, which stood on
the west side, opposite St. Helen’s Place. This
was one of the inns used for theatrical purposes in
the sixteenth century. In 1594, Anthony Bacon,
brother of Francis, was lodging in Bishopsgate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Street, to the regret of his mother, because he
was near the Bull Inn, where plays and interludes
were acted, which might corrupt his servants.
It was the house frequented by old Hobson,
the Cambridge carrier, on whom Milton
wrote his famous lines. Here, as the <i>Spectator</i>
tells us, there was a portrait of Hobson, with a
hundred-pound bag under his arm, having on it
the inscription:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘The fruitful mother of a Hundred more.’</p>

<p class="p1">At the Bull Inn a mutiny broke out in a troop
of Whalley’s regiment on April 26, 1649, for
which one of the troopers was shot in St. Paul’s
Churchyard, and others were condemned but pardoned.
The inn was pulled down in 1866. A
curious relic then rescued from the ruins consisted
of a stone 9-1/2 inches wide at the top, 7
inches at the bottom, and 10 inches deep, shaped
therefore like a keystone, and having a narrow
margin, within which was a carving of a bull with a
vine and its tendrils, and a bunch of grapes; it was
dated 1642. This stone had doubtless served as
a sign or commemorative decoration, and was the
oldest of its kind in London: I have not been
able to find out what became of it. The <i>Herts
Guardian</i> for March 11, 1865, records that
‘under the yew-tree, against the steeple of All
Saints’ Church, Hertford, is a small ordinary-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
gravestone having the following quaint inscription:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘Here lyeth Black Tom of the Bull Inn in Bishopsgate,
1696.’</p>

<p class="p1">From the Bull in Bishopsgate it is not a far cry
to the Bull and Mouth in Aldersgate. There are
two versions of this sign, and though comparatively
modern they are worth describing, partly for their
quaintness, partly from their interesting associations;
they are both preserved in the Guildhall
Museum. One was placed over the front entrance
of the Queen’s Hotel, St. Martin’s-le-Grand,
formerly known as the Bull and Mouth, which was
built in 1830 on the site of the old coaching inn
with that sign. A statuette of a bull appears within
the space of a gigantic open mouth; below are
bunches of grapes; above, a bust of Edward VI.
and the arms of Christ’s Hospital, to which
institution the ground belonged. Beneath is a
tablet, perhaps from the old inn, inscribed with
the following doggerel rhyme:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Milo the Cretonian an ox slew with his fist,<br />
And ate it up at one meal, ye Gods what a glorious twist.’</p>

<p class="pn1">Another version of the sign, which is said to have
been put up about the beginning of the century,
was over the entrance to the Great Northern Railway
receiving-house in Angel Street, formerly the
back entrance to the inn yard. This, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with the Queen’s Hotel and all the ground as far
as Bull and Mouth Street north, has now been
taken by the Post-Office authorities; the amount
of compensation paid to the Great Northern Company
having been £31,350.</p>

<p>The Bull and Mouth was one of the most
famous coaching inns. Strype, writing in 1720,
describes it as ‘large and well built, and of a
good resort by those that bring Bone Lace,
where the shopkeepers and others come to buy
it.’ He also tells us that ‘in this part of
St. Martin’s is a noted Meeting House of the
Quakers, called the Bull and Mouth, where
they met long before the Fire.’ The name is
generally supposed to be a corruption of Boulogne
Mouth, the entrance to Boulogne Harbour, that
town having been taken by King Henry VIII.
This elucidation is said to have originated with
George Steevens, who has been called a mischievous
wag in literary matters. Boyne thinks it
might have been originally the Bowl and Mouth,
both known London signs. A seventeenth-century
trade token was issued from a house with the sign of
the Mouth in Bishopsgate Street, and the Mouth
appears in the rhyming list of taverns, which is to
be found in Heywood’s ‘Rape of Lucrece.’ Stow
mentions the custom of presenting a bowl of
ale at St. Giles’s Hospital to prisoners on their
way from the City to Tyburn, and according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Parton there was a Bowl public-house at St.
Giles’s. Bowl Yard, a narrow court on the south
side of High Street, St. Giles’s, disappeared about
1846. Mr. Wheatley, points out in ‘London
Past and Present’ that our inn is probably identical
with ‘the house called the Mouth, near
Aldersgate in London&mdash;then the usual meeting
place for Quakers,’ to which the body of John
Lilburne was conveyed on his death, August 29,
1657. Five years afterwards, namely on October
26, 1662, it appears from Ellwood’s ‘Autobiography’
that he was arrested at a Quakers’
meeting held at the <i>Bull and Mouth</i>, Aldersgate,
and confined till December in the old Bridewell,
Fleet Street.</p>

<p>The Bull and Mouth was at its zenith as a
coaching inn during the early part of this century,
just before the development of railroads. Mr.
Edward Sherman was then landlord, having succeeded
Mr. Willans in the year 1823; he also
had the Oxford Arms, Warwick Lane. It was he
who rebuilt the old house, and made stabling
underground for a large number of horses. When
the business of coaching came to an end, the gateway
from St. Martin’s-le-Grand was partially
blocked up and became the main entrance to the
hotel, which, under a new name, flourished till its
final closing in the autumn of 1886. On September
28 of that year, the stock of wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
amounting to 750 dozen, was sold; during the
winter the house was used as an adjunct of the
General Post-Office. In July, 1887, the Jubilee
fittings of Westminster Abbey were sold by
auction in the large coffee-room. They consisted
of Brussels carpets, hangings, cushions, etc., and
produced upwards of £2,000. In the space cleared
shortly afterwards for the new post-office, a large
piece of the City wall has been discovered. The
old Bull and Mouth Inn, destroyed in 1830, with
its three tiers of galleries, was very picturesque:
many illustrations of it exist.</p>

<p>A seventeenth century trade-token was issued
from a Bull and Mouth in Bloomsbury, still
represented by a modern public-house at No. 31,
Hart Street.</p>

<p>A wooden carving of a Civet Cat was some years
since the appropriate sign of an old-fashioned perfumer’s
shop in Cockspur Street. An illustration
of it appears in the <i>Illustrated London News</i> for
December 13, 1856.</p>

<p>In 1642, when London was threatened by
Charles I., the citizens hastily encircled it with a
trench and a series of forts. Among these was one
with four half bulwarks at the Dog and Duck, in
St. George’s Fields. In 1651 a trade-token was
issued from the Dog and Duck; it has the initials
E M S, and on the obverse is a design almost
identical with the one I have described. There
were, however, other houses with this sign in
Southwark: one in Deadman’s Place near St.
Saviour’s Park, and another in Bermondsey Square.
Till about the middle of the eighteenth century
the Dog and Duck in St. George’s Fields seems
to have been only a small public-house, doubtless
with a pond attached to it, in which was carried
on the cruel sport of duck-hunting, then dear to
cockneys. The amusement consisted in the duck
diving among the reeds with the dog in fierce
pursuit; a good idea of it is given by Davenant in
the ‘Long Vacation in London,’ p. 289, where
reference is made to another district famous for
ducking-ponds:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Ho ho to Islington; enough!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>Fetch Job my son, and our dog Ruffe!<br />
For there in Pond,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> through mire and muck,<br />
We’ll cry hay Duck, there Ruffe, hay Duck.’</p>

<p class="p1">When this ceased to be an attraction in St.
George’s Fields is not recorded, but towards the
middle of last century the place came into the
hands of a Mrs. Hedger, who had been a barmaid.
While she was landlady, Sampson, an equestrian
performer, who had previously ridden at the Three
Hats, Islington, set up his temporary circus in a
field opposite the Dog and Duck. Crowds followed
him, and caused a great increase in Mrs.
Hedger’s business, so she sent for her son, afterwards
called ‘the King of the Fields,’ who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
said to have been at the time a post-boy at Epsom,
and he shrewdly made the most of his chance.
The money as it came in was invested in building
and other improvements; soon a mineral spring
was discovered&mdash;or invented&mdash;and the place became
for a time a popular health resort. A correspondent
of the <i>St. James’s Chronicle</i> in 1761 asks,
as a matter not admitting denial, ‘Does Tunbridge
or Cheltenham or Buxton Wells come up to (<i>inter
alia</i>) the Dog and Duck in St. George’s Fields?’
No less a man than Dr. Johnson recommended
the waters to his friend Mrs. Thrale. An advertisement
tells us of a bath there 200 feet long,
and nearly 100 in breadth, and old newspapers
record dinners, concerts, assemblies and all kinds
of gaiety at St. George’s, or the Dog and Duck
Spa. It must already have begun to go downhill
when Garrick described it thus in his Prologue to
‘The Maid of the Oaks,’ 1774:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘St. George’s Fields, with taste and fashion struck,<br />
Display Arcadia at the Dog and Duck;<br />
And Drury misses, here in tawdry pride,<br />
Are there Pastoras by the fountain side,<br />
To frowsy bowers they reel through midnight damps,<br />
With fauns half drunk, and dryads breaking lamps.’</p>

<p class="p1">Finally it was closed by the magistrates, and
after being occupied for a time by the School for
the Indigent Blind, was pulled down in 1811,
when, the Committee of the Bridge House Estate
having, in the previous year, agreed to exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
11 acres 3 roods here for the ground then covered
by Bedlam in Moorfields, which amounted to about
2½ acres, the erection of the present Bethlehem
Hospital was begun on the site.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It was then
or soon afterwards that our stone sign was built
into the new garden wall. Several illustrations
of the Dog and Duck Inn have been preserved.
A water-colour in the Crace collection by T. H.
Shepherd, purporting to be from a drawing of
1646, represents it as a gable-ended public-house,
with a gallery on one side, standing in the fields.
A view of the outside in Hedger’s time shows a
brick building of considerable dimensions. Then
there is a rather indecent design called ‘Beauty in
distress,’ with the Dog and Duck in the distance.
Lastly, a rare stippled engraving of the interior,
dated 1789, shows us ladies frail and fair, with
their attendant beaux, walking about and seated
at tables in a long room, which has an organ at
the end; the sign appears below.</p>

<p>Much might be written about the curious device
which appears in the left-hand division of the
stone sign imbedded in the wall of Bethlehem
Hospital. This is the mark of the Bridge House
Estate, and though in no sense heraldic, has been
described as an annulet ensigned with a cross
pattée, interlaced with a saltire conjoined in base.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
It is sometimes, but wrongly, called the Southwark
Arms, for arms cannot in truth be borne by any
public body, which has not received a charter of
incorporation, with a right to use a common seal;
and Southwark was never more than a ward of the
City. The device resembles a merchant’s mark,
but its origin has not hitherto been satisfactorily
explained. Perhaps a letter in the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> for October, 1758, from Joseph Ames,
secretary to the Society of Antiquaries, may throw
some light on the subject. It seems that in
pulling down a part of old London Bridge, three
inscriptions were found engraved on stone tablets.
The oldest dated from 1497. The second, which
most concerns us, had perhaps been inserted in the
building on the completion of repairs, rendered
necessary by a great fire at the northern end of
the bridge which occurred in 1504, and has now
found a home in the Guildhall Museum. It
measures 10 inches by 13-3/4, and is inscribed in
Gothic characters ‘Anno Domini 1509.’ At the
end of the date appears a cross<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> charged with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
small saltire, which seems to suggest the present
mark, and was not unlikely the old device for the
estate of London Bridge. The third stone, dated
1514, had on it the City sword and the initials of
Sir Roger Achiley, draper and alderman of Bridge
ward; they are represented below.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-073.jpg" width="350" height="158" id="i73"

         title="" />
</div>

<p>Here, perhaps, by way of illustration, a few
words may be introduced on the subject of
merchants’ marks. These, as early as the beginning
of the fifteenth century, were adopted
instead of armorial bearings by traders, to whom
arms were not permitted.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> They were used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
stamping goods, were engraved on rings, and often
placed on monuments as if they conveyed a
certain honourable distinction. Mr. J. G. Waller,
F.S.A.,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> has pointed out that these merchants’
marks have commonly one essential feature in
common&mdash;a cross. A simple form of mark was a
cross surmounting a mast or staff, with streamers
or other devices, apparently taken from parts of a
ship; it had a forked base. When after a time
initials of names were introduced, they at first
formed part of the mark, the letter A being often
made by crossing the forked base. The cross,
being an emblem of Christianity, was considered to
counteract the wiles of Satan; merchants, therefore,
naturally placed a cross on their bales as a preservative
against the tempests, which it was thought
were caused by him. Mr. W. de Gray Birch, on
the other hand, suggests that the cross and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
streamers so often incorporated in merchants’
marks, were derived from the banner of the Holy
Lamb, which was the usual emblem of St. John
Baptist, the patron saint of wool merchants&mdash;that
is, merchants of the staple; but it seems that such
devices were also used by the Merchant Adventurers,
Salters, etc.; moreover, the cross with
streamers is, in mediæval art, a symbol of the
victory of Christ over death and the powers of
darkness, which seems to confirm Mr. Waller’s
view. The Lamb and Flag, as I shall have occasion
to show, sometimes appeared on the seals of
the Knights Templars.</p>

<p>As to the Bridge House Estate, it is held in
trust by the corporation of the City of London,
and is, strictly speaking, intended for the support,
lighting and cleansing of the City bridges, and two
bridges over the Lea at Stratford, where the City
authorities hold some land. This property is
said to have originated in small offerings by pious
citizens to the Chapel of St. Thomas à Becket<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
on London Bridge. The earliest document
relating to it which is still in existence appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
be a small volume on vellum, probably dating
from the earlier part of the fourteenth century,
with additions made in the reign of King
Edward IV. A thorough examination of all the
records would be a work of great labour, but
would bring to light many interesting facts.</p>

<p>The property has by degrees increased in
value, till out of it they have been able to
rebuild London Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge,
and are now creating the huge structure by the
Tower. Much of St. George’s Fields belonged
to the estate; it had been Crown land, once
attached to Suffolk House, and was included
in the grant to the City, in the fourth year of
Edward VI.’s reign. The land on which stood
the Dog and Duck Tavern formed part of this
Bridge House Estate. The Bridge House itself
stood on the Surrey side of the water, in Tooley
Street, and was originally a storeplace for material
belonging to the City which was used
in the repair of London Bridge. In course of
time it became a granary and a bakehouse, with
public ovens. The grain was for the relief of
poor citizens in time of distress, and the ovens
were used for baking it. Stow tells us that they
were ten in number, six of them very large, and
that ‘Sir John Throstone, Knight, sometime an
embroiderer, then a goldsmith, one of the sheriffs
in 1516, gave by his testament towards the making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of these ovens two hundred pounds, which thing
was performed by his executors.’</p>

<p>The stone sign of a Fox sitting on its haunches,
with the initials <span class="smcap">h w</span> and date 1669, has been put
up inside the house at No. 24, Lombard Street,
and is in capital condition. It was found in
digging up the foundations of a house in
Clement’s Lane, destroyed to make room for No.
30, Lombard Street, which extends further south
than its predecessor. In the seventeenth century
there was a sign of a fox in Lombard Street, but
some distance off; No. 73 occupies the site. A
kindred sign, the Three Foxes, is said to have
formerly existed, also in Clement’s Lane, but about
this I am a little bit doubtful; there was a drawing
of it in the <i>Graphic</i> of April 21, 1877, which
could hardly have represented the actual tablet,
for Larwood and Hotten say that it had been
plastered over long before this, when the house
was taken by a firm of three lawyers, who wished
to avoid the rather awkward connection of ideas
which might be suggested.</p>

<p>Of the carving of a Griffin’s Head which
formerly existed in Old Jewry I know nothing,
except that it was drawn by Archer in 1850.
This was, perhaps, an heraldic charge of the
person who built, or first possessed, the house on
which it was placed. The badge of Fiennes, Lord
Dacre, was a griffin’s head erased, gules, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in its beak an annulet, or; that of Polle, a
griffin’s head erased, azure, ducally gorged, or.</p>

<p>On the east side of Shoreditch High Street,
between Nos. 79 and 80, and over the passage
leading into Hare Alley, is the sculptured stone
sign of a Hare running, with the initials <span class="smcap">b w m</span> and
date 1725. I have observed a similar sign in
Flushing. Hare Alley is mentioned in Hatton’s
‘New View of London,’ 1708. Among seventeenth
century trade-tokens is one with the
following inscription:</p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>O.</i> <span class="smcap">nicholas warrin</span>=A hare running.<br />
<i>R.</i> <span class="smcap">in aldersgate street</span>=N.I.W</p>

<p class="p1">So it is given in Boyne. A pun on the name is
probably intended, but unless the issuer was a
veritable cockney the animal represented was a
rabbit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-078.jpg" width="400" height="246" id="i78"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The Hare in combination with the Sun, having
the date 1676 and the initials <span class="smcap">h n a</span>, is still to be seen
above the first-floor windows of a house, No. 71,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
on the east side of the Borough High Street;
close to the sites of the three most famous Southwark
inns, the Tabard, the White Hart, and the
George; of which the last-named still exists in
part at least, though doomed, I fear, to speedy
destruction. This house was gutted by fire a few
years ago, but the sign luckily escaped unharmed.
It is now painted in various colours, which was
the old method, and, I think, improves the effect.
The solicitors of the property have kindly let me
examine the deeds, and I have gathered from them
the following particulars:</p>

<p>In March, 1653, John Tarlton, citizen and
brewer, left to his children two tenements in
Southwark. In a mortgage of 1663 they are
called ‘the Hare and the Three Pidgeons.’ In
May, 1676, all, or nearly all, this part of Southwark
was burnt down, the number of houses destroyed
being, as stated in the <i>London Gazette</i>, about 600.
A curious little pamphlet in my possession,
licensed May 29, puts the number at nearly 500.
On the title-page we are told that ‘St. Mary
Overy’s Church and St. Thomas’s Hospital’ were
‘shattered and defaced,’ and everything ‘from
Chain-Gate to the Counter on St. Margaret’s Hill
on both sides the way burnt and demolished.’ I
may note that on this occasion a fire-engine with
leathern hose was first used, and seems to have
been of great service in defending St. Thomas’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Hospital from the fire, as recorded in the <i>London
Gazette</i> for August 14, 1676. In the same month
Nicholas Hare, grocer, surrendered to be cancelled
a lease dated 1669, ‘of the messuage or
tenement called the Hare and Sunne,’ the said
messuage having been burnt in the fire; and the
Tarltons let him the ground on building lease for
eighty-one years from June, 1677. The rent had
before been £24 a year, with a fine for renewal of
£70; it was now reduced to £16 a year. The
sign in question is therefore a punning one, having
been put up by Nicholas Hare, grocer, after the
great Southwark fire, as many signs of the same
description had been put up in London a few
years previously, after the great London fire.
How the sun had got into combination with the
hare one does not know.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In subsequent documents,
down to the year 1748, when the house
came into the possession of John Paris, it is
described simply as the Hare. In his will, dated
1753, he speaks of ‘my dwelling-house near the
George Inn, known by the sign of the Hare and
Stirrup;’ and finally, in 1757, in a schedule of the
fixtures, are mentioned ‘in the dining-room two
large sign irons, and a large copper sign of the
Hare and Stirrup;’ so the unpretentious stone bas-relief,
though not taken down, appears to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
been supplemented by a sign more likely to catch
the eye. It may be noted that on these sculptured
signs, where letters occur, the initial of the
owner, builder, or first occupant, is usually placed
over the initials of the Christian names of himself
and his wife the former naturally being on the
left. Sometimes, however, they are all in a line, in
which case the initial of the surname is most likely
the middle one, as on the seventeenth-century
trade tokens.</p>

<p>Centuries ago, when Islington was a little
country town separated from London by roads
which were often impassable in winter, there stood
near the Green a picturesque house which, by its
style, appeared to have been built in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth. It was an old and general
tradition that this house, which in course of time
became the Pied Bull Inn, had been the residence
of Sir Walter Raleigh; but this seems to be nothing
more than a tradition.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> There is, however, strong
evidence that Sir John Miller, knight, of Islington
and Devon, lived here some years later, for a
window of a room on the ground-floor was
adorned with his arms in painted glass, impaling
those of Grigg of Suffolk, and in the kitchen were
the remains of the same arms, with the date 1624.
Nelson gives an illustration of the chimney-piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in the ground-floor room; it contained the figures
of Faith, Hope, and Charity in niches, with a
border of cherubim, fruit and foliage. The
central figure&mdash;Charity&mdash;was surmounted by two
cupids supporting a crown, and beneath were a
lion and unicorn couchant. Nelson thinks that
the design was intended as a compliment to Queen
Elizabeth. On the ceiling the five senses were
represented in stucco, with their Latin names. It
is not known at what time the house was converted
into an inn; during the seventeenth century, no
doubt, for Defoe mentions it in his fictitious
narrative of the Plague.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The south front of the
house was comparatively modern, and of different
elevation to the older part, and here appeared a
stone bas-relief of the Pied Bull, bearing the date
1730, the year perhaps in which this addition was
made to the building. In 1740 the house and
14 acres of land were let at about £70 a year;
it was pulled down in 1827. The modern public
house called the <i>Old</i> Pied Bull, at the corner of
Upper Street and Theberton Street, is about twenty
or thirty yards north of the site.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Guildhall Museum there is a well-executed
stone bas-relief in particularly good condition of a
Lion statant, size 8 inches by 14-1/4 inches. No
record of its origin has been preserved by the City
authorities. Can this be the lion referred to by
Leigh Hunt in ‘The Town’? His words are:
‘The only memorial remaining of the old palace
(Somerset House) and its outhouses is in the wall
of a house in the Strand, where the sign of a Lion
still survives a number of other signs, noticed in a
list at the time, and common at that period to
houses of all descriptions.’ More likely, however,
he refers to a carved lion supporting the City arms
which is still to be seen on a jeweller’s shop,
No. 342, Strand; but this is apparently of no great
age. The occupant, who has been there thirty
years, could give me no information about it.
Mr. Harrison in his ‘Memorials of London
Houses,’ says that Robert Haydon lodged here,
when as a youth of eighteen he first came to
London from Plymouth. In the seventeenth
century there was a Golden Lion by York House,
which, with other tenements pertaining to Denmark
or Somerset House, was sold in 1650 for the benefit
of the State.</p>

<p>Perhaps a more interesting sign than either of
the above is that of the White Lion, a boldly-executed
carving with the date 1724, which is still
to be seen between the first-floor windows of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
house, now a tobacconist’s, on the north side of
Islington High Street, but in the parish of
Clerkenwell. This was once the sign of an inn
which existed at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, if not earlier. In ‘Drunken Barnabee’s
Journal,’ the date of which is 1638, there occur
the following lines:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Thence to Islington, at Lion,<br />
Where a juggling, I did spy one,<br />
Nimble with his mates consorting,<br />
Mixing cheating with his sporting.’</p>

<p class="p1">There is a curious allusion in Pepys’ ‘Diary,’
January 21, 1667-8: ‘It seems, on Thursday last,
he (Joyce) went sober and quiet, and behind one
of the inns, the White Lion, did throw himself
into a pond.’<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> This Anthony Joyce was cousin to
Pepys; he had lost money by the Great Fire, and
afterwards kept the Three Stags, Holborn Conduit.
He was got out of the pond before life was extinct,
but died soon afterwards. Pepys was afraid that
his estate would be taken from his widow and
children, on the ground that he had committed
suicide, the legal consequences of which might
have been forfeiture of goods and chattels to the
Crown; but the coroner’s jury returned a verdict
that he had died of a fever. A trade-token gives
the name of the landlord at the time:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p class="pi4 p1"><i>O.</i> <span class="smcap">christopher.bvsbee.at</span> = A lion passant.<br />
<i>R.</i> <span class="smcap">whit.lion.in.islington.</span> = <span class="smcap">his.half.peny.</span> 1668.</p>

<p class="p1">Busby’s Folly, a house of entertainment, marked
in the old maps of Clerkenwell, and of which there
is an engraving in a rare volume called ‘Views
of divers Noted Places near London,’ 1731,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
possibly, as Burn suggests, originated with the
issuer of this token. T. Cromwell, in his ‘History
of Clerkenwell,’ published in 1828, gives us the
following information: ‘The White Lion, now a
public-house and wine-vaults, at the south-east
corner of the street of the same name, was originally
an inn much frequented by cattle-drovers and
others connected with the trade of Smithfield. It
then comprised the two dwelling-houses adjoining,
and extended also in the opposite or northward
direction, until the latter portion was pulled down
to make an opening to White Lion Row, as it was
then called, being that part of the existing White
Lion Street which was built between 1770 and
1780. Where Mr. Becket’s shop now is was the
gateway of the inn-yard, over which a lion rampant,
executed in relief and painted white, was
inserted in the front of the building.’ Nelson
tells us that the carriage-way was immediately
under the lion, and so continued till, the trade of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the inn declining, the building was converted into
a private house. The White Lion, one would
think, must first have been used as a sign by some
retainer of the Howards, who, by marriage with
Lady Margaret Mowbray, inherited, as a badge,
the blanch lion of the Mowbray family.</p>

<p>From the lion to the unicorn seems a natural
transition. A stone bas-relief of the latter animal
supporting a shield was formerly to be seen in
Cheapside, two doors east of the Chained Swan,
and opposite to Wood Street; but disappeared
some years ago, when the house to which it belonged
was rebuilt. Peter Cunningham, usually
so accurate, described it as a Nag’s Head. It
seems that Roger Harris (not Sir Roger Harrison,
as stated by Archer), who died in the year
1633, had owned the property, and by will
endowed the church of St. Michael’s, Crooked
Lane, with a rent-charge on it of £2 12s. for
the purchase of bread for the poor, which was
to be distributed every Sunday in the form of
one penny loaf for each one of twelve poor men
or widows in the parish. This amount is still
paid annually by the tenant of No. 39, Cheapside,
which stands on the site of the Unicorn; under
the present arrangement, it is administered by the
trustees of the London Parochial Charities. The
sign was of old standing. In Machyn’s ‘Diary’
the entry for 1 May, 1561, records the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
that ‘at afternoone dyd Mastyr Godderyke’s
sune the goldsmyth go hup into hys father’s
gylding house, toke a bowe-strynge and hanged
ymselff at the syne of the Unycorne, in
Chepsyd.’<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The unicorn first became a supporter of the
royal arms in James I.’s time, when it displaced the
red dragon of Wales, introduced by Henry VII.
Unicorns had been supporters of the Scottish
royal arms for about a century before the union of
the two crowns. A representation of the unicorn
often appeared in City shows. Cooke, in his
‘City Gallant,’ 1599, makes a City apprentice
exclaim: ‘By this light I doe not thinke but to
be Lord Mayor of London before I die, and have
three pageants carried before me, besides a ship
and an unicorn.’ This fabulous creature should
have the tail of a lion, the legs of a buck or goat,
the head and body of a horse, and a single twisted
horn in the middle of its forehead. It was used
as a sign by chemists and goldsmiths: by the
former, because the horn was considered an antidote
to all poisons; by the latter, on account of
the immense value put upon it. ‘Andrea Racci,
a Florentine physician, relates that it had been sold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
by the apothecaries at £24 per ounce, when the
current value of the same quantity of gold was
only £2 3s. 6d.’ (Larwood and Hotten, p. 160.)
The horn thus esteemed was probably narwhal’s
horn. The arms of the Apothecaries’ Company
are supported by unicorns.</p>

<p class="pch">BIRDS AND OTHER SCULPTURED SIGNS.</p>

<p class="pp6s">‘Emblems of Christ and immortality.’</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">THE next group of sculptured signs I should
like to consider is that in which birds are represented.
Several of them clearly had an heraldic
origin; but I am not aware that this was the case
with the Crane&mdash;a pretty sign empanelled in a
delicate moulding of small cut-brick, which stood
over the entrance to Crane Court, Lambeth Hill.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-089b.jpg" width="400" height="427" id="i89"

</div>

<p>It is said to have been destroyed in the year 1871.
One is reminded of the Three Cranes in the Vintry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
not far off, mentioned by Stow, Ben Jonson, and
others, the site of which is still marked by
Three Cranes Wharf, Upper Thames Street. The
‘Annals of John Stow,’ continued by Howes,
were ‘imprynted at the Three Cranes, in the
Vintrie.’</p>

<p>A sign of the same description was the Four
Doves, which, forty years ago, was to be seen in
front of a modern house in St. Martin’s le Grand.
Archer, who drew it, suggests that it was a rebus
on the joint owners of the property. The four
doves had the initial letters <span class="smcap">w. g. i. j.</span> Beneath
was the inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘This 4 <span class="smcap">dove</span> Ally 1670.’</p>

<p class="pn1">Four Dove Alley is marked in Horwood’s map
a short distance south of Angel Street, King’s
Court intervening. It is now covered by the
buildings of the General Post Office.</p>

<p>Yet another sculptured sign indicating the name
of a court was the Heathcock&mdash;in a handsome
shell canopy, which formerly graced the entrance
to Heathcock Court, Strand. It was removed in
July, 1844, in spite of the remonstrance of Mr.
Peter Cunningham, who wrongly supposed it to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the last sign of its class in London. Two picturesque
old houses fronting this court still remain.
A heathcock with wings expanded forms the crest
of the Coopers’ Company; but it does not appear
that they ever owned property in this neighbourhood.</p>

<p>As late as 1866 a stone bas-relief of an Ostrich
was to be seen in Bread Street, together with the
arms of the Tallowchandlers’ Company. Soon
afterwards the house was destroyed, and the sign
disappeared for many years, till it came, by chance,
into the hands of Mr. M. Pope, F.S.A., who has
kindly presented it to the Guildhall Museum.
The beak is a modern restoration. A rough
drawing, which, however, quite serves to identify
it, appeared in the <i>Illustrated London News</i> for
December 13, 1856, when it was suggested that it
might have served as the sign of a feather-dresser.
Mrs. Palliser<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> tells us that Mattei Girolamo, captain
of the guard to Clement VII., placed on his
flag an ostrich swallowing an iron nail, with the
motto, ‘Spiritus durissima coquit,’ ‘Courage
digests the hardest things’; that is, the brave
man is not easily daunted. Sir Thomas Browne
wrote a paper on the ostrich, for the use of his
son.</p>

<p>The Spread Eagle or ‘Eagle with two heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
displayed’ was, like the Ostrich, bought by Mr. Pope
some time since, and has also been presented to the
Guildhall Museum; he wrote a description of these
signs in the ‘London and Middlesex Notebook.’
Both signs were sold by the same person; they
had been in the possession of his family for many
years, and he believed that his father had obtained
them from the same neighbourhood in the City.
The Spread Eagle is in fair condition, though the
sinister head has been badly restored with cement.
It has on it the initials <span class="smcap">rm</span> and the date 1669.
I have no proof as to the original position of this
sign, but in the absence of fuller information one
can, I think, fairly hazard the conjecture, that
after the Great Fire it may have been put up in
Bread Street to perpetuate the memory of the
house in which John Milton, the poet, was born.
We know that his father, a scrivener, but a man
of good family, had adopted his own coat of arms
as a sign. Aubrey, a contemporary, says he had
another house in Bread Street, called the Rose.
In Masson’s Life of Milton there is a transcript
of a volume in the British Museum containing
miscellaneous notes, which relate to the affairs of
John Sanderson, a Turkey merchant, in the early
part of the seventeenth century. Among other
things there is a copy of a bond dated March 4,
160-2/3, in which Thomas Heighsham, of Bethnal
Green in Middlesex, and Richard Sparrow, citizen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and goldsmith of London, engage to pay Sanderson
a sum of money on May 5 following, the
payment to be made <i>at the new shop of John
Milton, scrivener, at the Spread Eagle in Bread
Street</i>. The signature of John Milton, scrivener,
is appended.</p>

<p>Some years since there existed in Bread Street
a Black Spread Eagle Court, at the first turning
on the left hand as one entered from Cheapside,
with, as Strype tells us, a very good house at the
upper end; in several directories of the eighteenth
century it is called Spread Eagle Court.
This is considered to have been on the site of
Milton’s birthplace; the ground is now covered
by modern warehouses&mdash;Nos. 58 to 63, occupied
by one firm. The Church of All Hallows, Bread
Street, in which Milton<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> had been baptized, was
swept away in 1878. Its site is marked by a bust
of the poet with an inscription, set up in the wall
of a new building. The Spread Eagle was by no
means an uncommon London sign; to the one
in Gracechurch Street I shall presently refer.
Collet,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> in his ‘Common-place Book,’ gives it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
his opinion that, ‘the eagle with two necks in the
imperial arms, and in the arms of the King of
Spain, depicted on signboards as the Spread Eagle,
signified the east and west empire, the extension
of their power from the east to the west.’ During
a great tempest at sea in January, 1506, Philip,
King of Castile and his Queen were weather
driven, and landed at Falmouth. The same storm
blew down the eagle of brass off the spire of St.
Paul’s Church in London, and in falling the same
eagle broke and shattered the black eagle that
hung for a sign in St. Paul’s Churchyard, as
related in Stow’s ‘Annals,’ p. 484.</p>

<p>An interesting sign of the Pelican is let into
the string course above a corner first-floor window
of No. 70, Aldermanbury. It was the crest of
two merchants who formerly occupied the house.
Their monument is in the neighbouring church
of St. Mary, Aldermanbury, the inscription being
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Here lyeth the body of Richard Chandler,<br />
Citizen and Haberdasher of London, Esquire,<br />
Who departed this life November 8th, 1691, aged 85.<br />
Also the body of John Chandler, Esqre, his brother,<br />
Citizen and Haberdasher of London,<br />
Who died October 14th, 1686, aged 69 years.’</p>

<p class="p1">Above is the Pelican as a crest, corresponding
with the sign. The busts of these two worthy
citizens in flowing periwigs appear on each side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the inscription; their names are in the Little
London Directory for 1677. The church was
burnt down in the Great Fire, and rebuilt by Sir
Christopher Wren, the parishioners subscribing
liberally; Richard Chandler gave the font in 1675.
The notorious Judge Jeffreys, who died in the
Tower of London and was buried in the chapel
there, was afterwards, on petition of his family,
reinterred in the church of St. Mary, Aldermanbury.
Here also Milton was married to his
second wife, Catherine Woodcock. In 1890 the
churchyard was opened to the public as a recreation
ground.</p>

<p>The pelican<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in her piety, or feeding her young
with her blood, was often represented in the
Mediæval Church, being considered a mystical
emblem of Christ, and a type of the Holy
Eucharist. Several representations of it are to be
seen in St. Mary Abchurch, the living of which is
in the gift of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.
It was the device of the famous Bishop Foxe, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
whom I have alluded in my account of the Three
Kings (<i>ante</i>); and as such appears on the woodwork
of the banqueting hall of Durham Castle, with his
usual motto, ‘Est Deo gracia;’ and on the string
course of the choir of St. Saviour’s, Southwark.
He died anno 1528. Heywood in his play of
Edward IV. (4to. 1600), mentions a pelican sign
in Lombard Street:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Here’s Lombard Street, and here’s the Pelican;<br />
And here’s the Phœnix in the Pelican’s nest.’</p>

<p class="p1">And by a curious coincidence, at the present
day there are the signs of a Pelican and a
Phœnix in Lombard Street, both belonging to
famous insurance offices. The house<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> occupied
by the latter was built for Sir Charles Asgill,
Lord Mayor in 1757.</p>

<p>A bas-relief, similar in style to that last described,
is the Swan with collar and chain, inserted below
a second-floor window of No. 37, Cheapside,
which stands at the north-east corner of Friday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Street. This is on the site of the Nag’s Head
tavern, whose projecting sign appears in a well-known
print of the procession of Mary de Medici
on a visit to her daughter, Queen Henrietta
Maria&mdash;an interesting record of the appearance of
Cheapside before the Great Fire. The sign was
almost opposite Cheapside Cross. The Nag’s
Head was the supposed scene of the consecration
of Archbishop Parker, on the accession of Queen
Elizabeth in 1559. This story is refuted in
Strype’s Life of Parker; it probably arose from a
fact mentioned by Fuller, that the commissioners
who confirmed Parker’s election (at St. Mary le
Bow Church ten days before the consecration),
afterwards dined together at the Nag’s Head
close by. The present building must have been
erected soon after the Great Fire, for a staircase,
to which there is access from Friday Street,
evidently dates from that century. Indeed, in the
Creed Collection at the British Museum (vol. xiii.)
there is a newspaper cutting said to be from the
<i>Builder</i>, but without a date, in which it is, no
doubt erroneously, asserted that the house was
there before the year 1666, and remained standing
when all around was swept away, and that inside
traces of the fire may be observed on the massive
beams. The Chained Swan is undoubtedly of
heraldic origin. Ritson says it was not customary
to use the English language at court till King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Edward III. on the occasion of a celebrated
tournament, held at Canterbury in 1349, placed
on his shield the device of a white swan, with the
legend:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Hay, hay the wythe Swan,<br />
By Gode’s soule I am thy man.’</p>

<p class="p1">The Mandevilles, Earls of Essex, bore as their
arms, gules, a swan argent, ducally collared and
chained or, which the Bohuns, who were
descended from them, adopted; and for this
reason, no doubt, it became a badge of King
Henry IV., who was a Bohun on the mother’s
side. It is represented in the central spandrel of
the canopy of the brass in Westminster Abbey to
Eleanora de Bohun, Duchess of Gloucester, who
died in 1399. From such high beginnings the
Chained Swan gradually came, as we see, to be
used as a tavern sign. Another specimen, carved
in stone, was the sign of a house in Eastcheap, not
far from the Boar’s Head. It is mentioned by
Pennant, and by J. T. Smith, but disappeared
early in this century.</p>

<p>Here I am tempted to say a few words about
the Swan with Two Necks, because, though now
only represented by modern bas-reliefs at No. 65,
Gresham Street, and in Aldermanbury, they recall
the memory of a famous inn, and the sign is one
of the quaintest in London. The Swan with Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Necks ‘at Milke Street end’ is noticed by Machyn
in his ‘Diary,’ August 5, 1556. In 1637, as we
learn from Taylor, the Water Poet, carriers from
Manchester and other places lodged at the Two-necked
Swan in Lad Lane. Towards the end of
last century it became a great coaching centre, and
continued to flourish till steam drove the coaches
off the road, when it revived in a new form. Mr.
Stanley Harris, in his amusing book, ‘Old Coaching
Days,’ says that ‘the gateway out of the yard
of the Swan with Two Necks, through which the
various coaches passed, and Milk Lane and Lad
Lane, was so narrow that it required some horsemanship
to drive out a fast team just started, and
some care on the part of the guard, that his horn
or bugle basket, which was usually hung on to the
iron of the back seat of the coach nearest the roof,
was not jammed against the gate-post. Between
four and five on an afternoon was a time worth
being in that same yard of the Swan with Two
Necks for anyone who took an interest in coaching.’
The proprietor of this establishment was
Mr. William Chaplin, who, originally a coachman,
became, perhaps, the greatest coach proprietor that
ever lived. ‘Nimrod,’ writing about 1835, tells us
that at that time Mr. Chaplin occupied the yards
of no fewer than five famous and important inns
in London, namely the Spread Eagle and Cross
Keys, Gracechurch Street; the Swan with Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Necks, Lad Lane; the White Horse, which still
exists in Fetter Lane, and the Angel, behind St.
Clement’s. He had no fewer than 1,300 horses
at work on various roads, and about that time
horsed 14 out of the 27 coaches leaving London
every night. When the railways came he bowed
to the inevitable, and, in partnership with Mr.
Horne, established the great carrying business,
which still flourishes on the site of the old Swan
with Two Necks. In 1845 Lad Lane was absorbed
by Gresham Street.</p>

<p>The origin of the sign has been disputed, but it
is generally considered to have arisen as follows:
The swans on the upper reaches of the Thames
are owned respectively by the Crown, and the
Dyers’ and Vintners’ Companies of the City of
London, and, according to ancient custom, the
representatives of these several owners make an
expedition each year up the river and mark the
cygnets. The royal mark used to consist of five
diamonds, the dyers’ of four bars and one nick,
the vintners’ of the chevron or letter V and two
nicks. The word ‘nicks’ has been corrupted into
necks, and as the vintners were often tavern-keepers,
the Swan with Two Necks became a
common sign. The swan-marks which I have
described continued in use until the year 1878,
when the swanherds were prosecuted by the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
on the ground that they inflicted unnecessary pain.
Although the prosecution failed, the marks have
since been simplified. In August, 1888, the
Queen’s swan-keeper and the officials of the Vintners’
and Dyers’ Companies, during the process
of ‘swan-upping,’ as it is termed, captured and
nicked 343 birds, of which 178 were claimed by
her Majesty, 94 by the Vintners’, and 71 by the
Dyers’ Company. To the constable of the Tower
formerly belonged the right of ‘lifting’ all swans
which came below bridge. A swan not marked is
supposed to belong to the Crown. The earliest
extant record giving leave to the Vintners’ Company
to keep a certain number of swans on the
river is dated 1509.</p>

<p>An inn with this sign painted in front is still to
be seen on the south side of Carter Lane; it has a
yard at the back and some remains of old galleries.</p>

<p>Not many years ago a curious sign was placed
in front of No. 16, Church Street, formerly
Church Lane, Chelsea, having been dug up in the
small back garden which was built over a short
time previously. The material of this sign is cast
iron; it is therefore not, strictly speaking, a sculptured
sign, but may, I think, be fairly included in
the same class. The design (see <i>ante</i>, 89) is like that
of a seventeenth-century fire-back, and represents
a cock vigorously attempting to swallow a snake
which he has seized by the tail; a second snake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
on the ground behind him rears its head as if to
strike. Above is the date 1652. When this sign
first saw the light, Chelsea was a detached village
grouped near the old church, with fine villas of
noblemen in the immediate neighbourhood. On
the east side of Church Lane houses were continuous
from the church to the parsonage; one of
them was doubtless known as the Cock, but I have
no special information about it. A curious fact has,
however, come to light, tending to show that signs
of this description were kept in stock, and repeated
again and again. In 1874 a sign was dug up in
the foundations of Messrs. Smith, Payne, and
Smith’s Bank, No. 1, Lombard Street, which, on
comparison, I find to be similar in all respects, and,
as far as I can judge, cast from the same mould.
No. 1, Lombard Street is on the site of the east
end of the Stocks Market, cleared away in 1737
to make room for the Mansion House. I find
from the ‘Handbook of Bankers,’ by Mr. F. G.
Hilton Price, F.S.A., that in 1734 there was a
house here with the sign of the Cock in the
occupation of Thomas Stevenson, fishmonger.
Later in the century the site was occupied by
Messrs. Harley and Co., bankers. A sign of
similar kind, perhaps really a decorated fire-back,
is to be seen at the entrance to a Cock Tavern
near Billingsgate. This appears to be considerably
older. It has been very much damaged; possibly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
as the owner says, in the Great Fire of
London.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-103.jpg" width="400" height="478" id="i103"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>To the genuine Londoner a more interesting
sign than either of the above is the carved wooden
figure of a cock, which is a relic of that famous
old tavern, the Cock in Fleet Street. A house so
historic needs no detailed description from me.
The sign is quite worthy of Grinling Gibbons, to
whom&mdash;but without authority&mdash;it has often been
attributed. This formerly stood over the doorway.
Some years ago it was stolen, but shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
afterwards restored, and to prevent accidents it
is now kept inside<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the house of entertainment,
on the opposite side of the street, to which,
after the destruction of his old home, the proprietor,
the late Mr. Colnett, removed. He also
with pious care preserved the quaint Jacobean
mantelpiece, which so many of us were familiar
with before it shifted its quarters. If the kind
reader wishes to refresh his memory with the sight
of these and other relics, let him pay a visit to the
new Cock, where he will find excellent fare and the
utmost attention from Paul, who comes from the
old house&mdash;a worthy successor of ‘the plump headwaiter
at the Cock,’ whom Lord Tennyson has
immortalized.</p>

<p>A newspaper paragraph has reminded me of a
sign with a history, which I once saw in the
Minories. In the year 1719 a boy was born of
humble parentage in Whitechapel, who, as Benjamin
Kenton, vintner and philanthropist, achieved
a considerable reputation. He was educated at
the charity school of the parish, and in his fifteenth
year apprenticed to the landlord of the
Angel and Crown in Goulston Street, Whitechapel.
Having served his time, he became
waiter and drawer at the Crown and Magpie in
Aldgate High Street, not long since pulled down.
The sign was a Crown of stone and a Magpie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
carved in pear-tree wood, and the house was
frequented by sea captains. Kenton’s master is
said to have been among the first who possessed
the art of bottling beer for warm climates. He,
without reason, changed the sign to the Crown;
his custom fell off; he died, and the concern came
into the hands of Kenton, who restored the Magpie
to its former position, and so increased the
bottled-beer business, that in 1765 he gave up the
tavern and removed to more commodious quarters
which he built in the Minories. His monogram
is still to be seen over the door. Here he soon
developed an extensive wine trade, and having
received excellent advice as to investments from
Mr. Harley, then alderman of Portsoken Ward,
he eventually realized between a quarter and half
a million of money. He was a large benefactor
to various charities and to the Vintners’ Company,
of which he had been master in 1776. An annual
dinner in their hall takes place to his memory, the
funds being provided under his will. Members
of the company also attend an annual sermon in
memory of his benefactions at Stepney Church,
where he was buried. The wine business is still
carried on at the house built by him in the
Minories, and here the Magpie sign has found a
fitting home. The stone Crown has unfortunately
crumbled to pieces.</p>

<p>A few sculptured signs are classed together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
because, though they have nothing special in
common, they cannot well be fitted in elsewhere.
I shall begin with a stone bas-relief of
an Anchor, which has found its way into the
Guildhall Museum, where it is described as
having been presented by the executors of James
Bare. It has on it the initials <span class="smcap">b h e</span> and the date
1669; no record has been kept of its original
position. The anchor&mdash;the emblem of true faith&mdash;is
associated with St. Clement, who, according
to tradition, was cast into the sea with an anchor
round his neck, by order of the Emperor Trajan,
on account of his firm adherence to Christianity.
An anchor forms the vane of the church of St.
Clement Danes, Strand; it also appears on various
parts of the church, and on the tablets which show
the boundaries of the parish&mdash;in fact, the parish
marks, one or two of which are as old as the
seventeenth century. A specimen on the house
numbered 11 on the west side of New Square,
Lincoln’s Inn, is dated 1693.</p>

<p>Sir George Buc, writing in 1615, tells us that
‘an anchor without a stocke,’ with a capital C
couchant upon it, ‘was graven in stone, over the
gate of St. Clement’s Inn.’ A good old-fashioned
carving of an anchor was on the front of Clement’s
Inn Hall, lately destroyed.</p>

<p>A common sign in the seventeenth century was
the Bell; but long before this it had been immortalized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Chaucer, when he describes the gathering
place of his pilgrims to Canterbury, tells us that it
was ‘in Southwark, at this gentil hostelrie, that
highte, the Tabard, faste by the Belle,’ the Bell being
apparently at that time a better known inn. It was
on the west side of the Borough High Street, and still
existed when Rocque published his map in 1746.
The site is now occupied by Maidstone Buildings.
Another famous Bell Inn is recorded in the list of
expenses of Sir John Howard: ‘Nov 15, 1466.
Item my mastyr spent for his costes at the Belle
at Westemenstre iijs. viijd.’ There are still two
capital stone bas-reliefs of this sign. One I happened
by chance to observe below a second-floor
window, in a courtyard which once was attached to
the Red Lion Inn, the house in front being numbered
251, High Holborn; it has on it the
initials <span class="smcap">a t a</span> and date 1668, and is evidently not in
its original position; the date would lead one to
suppose that it comes from a house in the City.</p>

<p>A sign of more interest, at least from its associations,
has lately found a home in the Guildhall
Museum. It is in high relief, and was formerly
placed between the first and second floor windows of
No. 67, Knightrider Street; on the keystones of the
three first-floor windows were the initials <span class="smcap">m t a</span>  and
the date 1668. The house was swept away three
years ago; I know nothing about it, except that
it was a fair specimen of the plain brick buildings
commonly put up after the Great Fire. There
was, however, a hostelry with the same sign hard
by, which had a proud distinction.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>From the
Bell Inn, Carter Lane, Richard Quyney wrote in
1598 to his ‘loveing good ffrend and contreyman,
Mr. Will<sup>m</sup> Shackespere,’ the only letter addressed
to our greatest poet which is known to exist. It is
now preserved at Stratford-on-Avon. The Bell
is also mentioned in that quaint guide-book to
taverns, the ‘Vade Mecum for Malt-worms,’
written, it is supposed, in 1715; and a seventeenth-century
trade-token was issued from Bell Yard,
not yet destroyed, a passage through which connects
Knightrider Street with Carter Lane. Adjoining
it, there is now a modern Bell tavern,
where Dickens is said to have often rested when
making notes for ‘David Copperfield.’</p>

<p>That the Bell should be a common sign is
natural enough, from its connection with the
worship of the Christian Church, and the popularity
of bell-ringing in England. A gold or
silver bell was often used as a prize at horse-races;
hence the expression, to ‘bear away the bell.’
Fine specimens of these bells were to be seen in
the Sports Exhibition, at the Grosvenor Gallery, a
few years since. One from Carlisle had on it the
date 1599, and the following distich:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘The Sweftes horse the bel to tak<br />
For mi Lade Daker sake.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">In Dudley, Lord North’s ‘Forest of Varieties,’
p. 175, occur the following lines:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Jockey and his horse were by their masters sent,<br />
To put in for the bell&mdash;<br />
They are to run, and cannot miss the bell.’</p>

<p class="p1">A sign which has disappeared and left no trace
was the bas-relief of a Bible and Crown, formerly
at the corner of Little Distaff (now Distaff) Lane,
within the precincts of St. Paul’s; it disappeared
some time after the year 1856. Larwood thinks
that this sign came into fashion among the Royalists
during the political troubles of Charles I.’s
reign. A more probable suggestion seems to
be, that forming part of the arms of Oxford
University, it indicated one of the presses licensed
to sell the Authorized Edition of the Bible. A
wooden carving of a Bible and Crown, painted
and gilt, was, till 1853, let into the string course
above a window of the house of Messrs. Rivington
and Co., in Paternoster Row. It then moved
westward to Waterloo Place, and is now in the
possession of Messrs. Longmans, whose sign was
the Ship and Black Swan, and who have absorbed
the older firm. Messrs. Rivington were originally
established in St. Paul’s Churchyard in the year
1711, when, on the death of Richard Chiswell the
elder, his house and business passed into their
hands. He has been called the ‘metropolitan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
bookseller of England,’ and published many important
works, of which a list is given in the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>. His sign&mdash;the Rose and
Crown&mdash;was changed by Charles Rivington, his
successor, into the Bible and Crown. Messrs.
Longmans date, it is said, from 1725.</p>

<p>On a level with the fourth-floor windows of a
shop at the corner of Canon Alley and No. 63, St.
Paul’s Churchyard, is a sculptured sign of the
Prince of Wales’s feathers, with the motto ‘Ich
Dien,’ and date 1670; being a handsome work
of art, we give it as an illustration. The
property belonged to the Dean and Chapter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
but is now vested in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.
An advertisement in the <i>Kingdom’s Intelligencer</i>,
No. 11, March 10, 1661-2, shows that
there was a Feathers Tavern in St. Paul’s Churchyard.
This, however, was at the west end; a
seventeenth-century trade-token was issued from
it. The heraldic origin of the feather badge,
and its connection with Edward the Black Prince,
has been fully traced by various authorities; the
motto is usually pronounced to be low German,
or old Flemish, as well as the word ‘Houmout,’
meaning high mood or courage, which the Prince
also wrote in a letter. His crest or badge was
sometimes three feathers, sometimes one, argent.
They are placed separately on his tomb in Canterbury
Cathedral. An ostrich feather was one of
the badges of King Edward III., and John of
Gaunt used three or one. The old belief&mdash;that this
crest was won by Edward the Black Prince from
the blind King John of Bohemia, at the battle of
Cressy, is contradicted by modern research; for
King John’s crest was not a plume of ostrich
feathers, but a vulture’s wing expanded. It has
been thought probable that the Prince assumed it
out of deference to his mother, Queen Philippa of
Hainault.</p>

<p>The carved sign of a Helmet was to be seen,
not long since, over the entrance to Helmet Court,
which was on the south side of London Wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
between Basinghall and Coleman Streets, and close
to the Armourers’ and Braziers’ Hall, in whose
arms the helmet is a charge. The date on it was
1686, with initials <span class="smcap">h m</span>. In the seventeenth century
there was a Helmet Inn not far off. Messrs.
Larwood and Hotten quote lines from Ned Ward,
who says that the trainbands, after practising in
Moorfields, long</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘For Beer from the Helmet in Bishopsgate,<br />
And why from the Helmet? Because that sign<br />
Makes the liquor as welcome t’ a soldier as wine.’</p>

<p class="pn1">In 1550, a helmet was the sign of Humphrey Joy,
bookseller in St. Paul’s Churchyard.</p>

<p>On each side of the spot where Bishopsgate once
stood, are stone bas-reliefs of mitres, with inscriptions
recording the fact. I learn that the gate was
sold by the Commissioner of City Lands, on
Wednesday, December 10, 1760, for immediate
demolition. It had been rebuilt in 1731, at the
expense of the City; when almost finished, the
arch fell down, but luckily no one was hurt.
The rooms in the ancient gatehouse were appropriated
to one of the Lord Mayor’s carvers; he
afterwards had a money allowance in lieu thereof.</p>

<p>Another carving of a mitre surmounts a tablet,
with initials <span class="smcap">t f</span> and the date 1786, which is built
into the front of that well-known tavern, the
Goose and Gridiron, and indicates that this property
is or was attached to the See of London, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that near this site stood the residence of the Bishops
of London, before the Great Fire, which destroyed
it. This mitre, by a coincidence, also suggests
the supposed former sign. Within the memory
of man, the Goose and Gridiron was a celebrated
house-of-call for coaches to Hammersmith, and
the villages west of London. Its sign, a sculptured
goose standing by a veritable gridiron, still
appears on a lamp in front. Before the Great
Fire, there was a house with the sign of the Mitre
hereabouts, perhaps on this very spot, where in the
year 1642 were to be seen, among other curiosities,
‘a choyce Egyptian with hieroglyphicks, a Rémora,
a Torpedo, the Huge Thighbone of a Giant,’
etc., as advertised in the <i>News</i>; and again, in
1644, Robert Hubert, <i>alias</i> Forges, ‘Gent., and
sworn servant to his Majesty,’ exhibited a museum
of natural rarities. The catalogue describes them
as ‘collected by him with great industrie; and
thirty years’ travel into foreign countries; daily to
be seen at the place called the Musick-house at the
Mitre, near the west end of St. Paul’s Church.’</p>

<p>Concerts were, no doubt, among the attractions
the house afforded, till the Great Fire in September,
1666, destroyed all. It has been suggested
that on the rebuilding of the premises, the new
tenant, to ridicule the character of the former
business, chose as his sign a goose stroking the
bars of a gridiron with her foot, and wrote below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
‘The Swan and Harp.’ Larwood and Hotten
think that it was a homely rendering of a charge
in the coat of arms of the Musicians’ Company.
That the Swan and Harp was an actual sign, I
learn from the <i>Little London Directory</i> of 1677,
where one is mentioned in Cheapside.</p>

<p>At the Goose and Gridiron, Sir Christopher
Wren presided over the St. Paul’s Lodge of Freemasons
for upwards of eighteen years.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It is said
that he presented the Lodge with three carved
mahogany candlesticks, and the trowel and mallet
which had been used in laying the first stone of
the Cathedral. In the ‘Vade Mecum for Malt-worms,’
there is a rude drawing of the sign, and
we are told in doggerel as rude that,</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Dutch carvers from St. Paul’s adjacent dome,<br />
Hither to whet their whistles daily come.’</p>

<p class="p1">Also that ‘the rarities of the house are; 1, the
odd sign; 2, the pillar which supports the chimney;
3, the skittle ground upon the top of the house;
4, the watercourse running through the chimney;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
5, the handsome maid, Hannah.’ Foote mentions
the Goose and Gridiron in his ‘Comedy of Taste.’</p>

</div>

<p>Yet another Mitre sign exists in London, probably
far older than any of those I have described.
In Mitre Court, a narrow passage between Hatton
Garden and Ely Place, stands a comparatively
modern public-house, let into the front wall of
which is a Mitre carved in bold relief; on it is
cut or scratched the date 1546, which, however,
appears to be a modern addition. This is said to
have formed part of the town residence of the
Bishops of Ely, the remains of which, with the
ground attached to it, were conveyed to the
Crown in 1772. The site was afterwards sold to
an architect named Cole, who levelled everything
except the chapel. This last building stands hard
by, and is dedicated to St. Etheldreda. The Rev.
W. J. Loftie considers that it is the most complete
relic of the fourteenth century in London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Since he wrote, however, the restorer has, alas!
been busy. In 1772 it stood in an open space of
about an acre, planted with trees and surrounded
by a wall; at that time the hall, seventy-two feet
long, and a quadrangular cloister existed. Over
the chief entrance the sculptured arms of the see,
surmounted by a mitre, were still visible, and it is
likely that this mitre was afterwards converted
into the sign I am considering. The rural
character of the neighbourhood in early days may
be judged by the records of it which have come
down to us. In 1327 Bishop Hotham purchased
a house and lands, including vineyard, kitchen-garden
and orchard contiguous to his manor of
Holborn, which, with other properties, he settled
on the church of Ely, dividing them between his
successors the Bishops, and the convent. Again,
as late as 1576, when Sir Christopher Hatton,
Queen Elizabeth’s handsome Lord Chancellor,
became tenant of part of the house and garden,
the rent was a red rose, ten loads of hay and £10
a year; Bishop Cox, on whom the bargain was
forced by the Queen, reserving to himself and his
successors the right of walking in the gardens
and gathering twenty bushels of roses annually.
Shakespeare, too, praises the quality of the strawberries
in Ely Garden, though little more than
sixty years afterwards we have John Evelyn complaining
in his ‘Fumifugium’ that smoke is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
‘suffering nothing in our gardens to bud, display
themselves, or ripen; so as our anemones and
many other choycest flowers, will by no industry
be made to blow in London or the precincts of it.’
Ely Place seems to have been let by the see to
John of Gaunt, ‘time-honoured Lancaster,’ and
here in 1399 he breathed his last. The present
town residence of the Bishops of Ely, No. 37,
Dover Street, has been occupied by them since
1772. It has a mitre carved over one of the first-floor
windows; Sir Robert Taylor, R.A., was the
architect.</p>

<p>At No. 10, Bow Churchyard a square brick
house was lately standing, which dated from
immediately after the Great Fire. The office
windows on the ground-floor, with their shutters
to match, had an air of old-fashioned quaintness.
The pediment of the doorway contained the
Royal Arms and supporters carved in wood; the
quarterings showed that they were put up in the
time of the early Georges; let into the western
part of the house, which from the arrangement of
the windows seemed to have been originally
divided into two, was a sign of spherical form,
projecting from a square stone, at the corners of
which one could with difficulty decipher the
figures 1669. In the kitchen there was a leaden
tank with initials and date, <span class="smcap">t. s.</span> 1670, supplied by
water from the New River. This house was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
pulled down two years ago; the sign came into
the hands of the City authorities, and is now in
the Guildhall Museum, where it has been christened
the Pill.</p>

<p>No. 10, Bow Churchyard was at the time of its
destruction occupied by Messrs. Sutton and Co.,
who there carried on a very old-established business
for the sale of patent medicines, among others
that which has been known for more than two
hundred years as Elixir Salutis, or Daffey’s Elixir.
It was stated that the house had formerly been
known by the sign of the Boar’s Head, which,
together with the Royal Arms, appeared on the
bill-heads of the firm. If so, there must have
been frequent changes here, for in the early part
of the eighteenth century it seems to have been
called the Maidenhead, to judge from various
advertisements in my possession: for instance, the
following from a London journal of 1728, which
is adorned by a portrait of a typical maiden,
appropriately framed:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘At the Maidenhead, behind<br />
Bow Church, in Cheapside, is sold for<br />
Two shillings the Bottle, that admirable<br />
Cordial, Daffey’s Elixir Salutis,<br />
It has been in great Use these 50 years.’</p>

<p class="p1">Confirming this statement there is a notice of
the medicine dating from 1673. It occurs in
Martindale’s autobiography (printed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Chetham Society), where we are told of his
daughter, who seems to have fallen into a decline:
‘That which seemed to do her most good was
Elixir Salutis, for it gave her much ease (my Lord
Delamer having bestowed upon her severall
bottles that came immediately from Mr. Daffie
himselfe) and it also made her cheerful; but going
forth and getting new cold, she went fast away.
I am really perswaded that if she had taken it a
little sooner, in due quantities, and beene carefull
of herselfe, it might have saved her life. But it
was not God’s will.’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">VARIOUS CRESTS AND COATS OF ARMS.</p>

<p class="pp8s p1">‘Coats in heraldry,</p>
<p class="pp6">Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.’</p>
<p class="pr12 reduct"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>: <i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap00">A VAST amount of property in London is
owned by the City Companies, and houses
which belong to them are as a rule marked by their
arms or crest. These were formerly carved in stone,
and a few fine old specimens still remain, similar in
style to the ordinary sculptured house signs. Sometimes,
no doubt, a citizen put up on his own house,
as a sign, the arms of the guild of which he was a
member; and this seems to have been the case
with the stone bas-relief of Adam and Eve, which
was formerly imbedded in the front wall of
No. 52, Newgate Street, a house now rebuilt.
Eve appeared handing the fatal apple to Adam,
the tree in the centre, round its stem the serpent
twining; at the upper corners were the initials
<span class="smcap">l s</span>, below the date 1669. It represented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
arms of the Fruiterers’ Company, but I have not
been able to discover that the house had ever
belonged to them. At Milton next Sittingbourne,
on a public-house formerly the Fruiterers’ Arms,
now misnamed the Waterman’s Arms, is a similar
carved sign, one of the few I have found out of
London. Beneath is inscribed ‘The Fruiterers.’
The design appears on a seventeenth-century
trade-token issued from Rosemary Lane. The
arms of the Fruiterers’ Company, as blazoned in
Hatton’s ‘New View of London’ (1708), are:
azure, on a mount in base vert, the tree of Paradise
environed with the serpent between Adam and
Eve, all proper. Motto, ‘Deus dat incrementum.’
What Ruskin calls the ‘fig-tree angle’ of the
Doge’s Palace, Venice, is adorned by a famous
piece of sculpture representing this subject.</p>

<p>The Elephant and Castle is the crest of the
Cutlers’ Company. A stone bas-relief representing
it is to be seen on the east side of Bell Savage
Yard, Ludgate Hill, having been placed there
nearly thirty years ago, some time after the
famous old inn was levelled with the ground. It
formerly stood over the gateway below the sign
of the Bell. In 1568 John Craythorne gave the
reversion of this inn, and after his death the house
called the Rose in Fleet Street, to the Cutlers’
Company for ever, on condition that two exhibitions
to the Universities, and certain sums to poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
prisoners, should be paid to them out of the
estate. A portrait of Mrs. Craythorne hangs in
Cutlers’ Hall. In mediæval times the elephant
was commonly depicted with a castle on its back.
It was then the heraldic emblem of Rome, and
appears as such on the floor of the cathedral at
Siena.</p>

<p>The Bell Savage Inn which came to be thus
associated with the Elephant and Castle, was one
of the oldest and most famous hostelries in
London. As long ago as 31 Henry VI. it is
described in a deed as Savage’s Inn, otherwise the
Bell on the Hoop, thus proving the origin of the
sign, which from the time of Stow to that of
Addison had caused so many ingenious but faulty
surmises. Here plays were performed, and Bankes
showed his wonderful horse Marocco. Lambarde,
in his ‘Perambulation of Kent,’<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> tells us that
‘none who go to Paris Garden, the Bel Savage,
or Theatre, to behold bear-baiting, interludes, or
fence-play, can account of any pleasant spectacle,
unless they first pay one penny at the gate, another
at the entry of the scaffold, and a third for a quiet
standing.’ It was ‘upon a stall’ over against the
Bell Savage gate that Sir Thomas Wyat ‘stayd
and rested him awhile,’ when foiled in his ill-advised
rebellion; as related by Howe, the continuator
of Stow’s ‘Annals.’ And Grinling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Gibbons once occupied a house in the yard, where,
as Horace Walpole says, ‘he carved a pot of flowers
which shook surprisingly with the motion of the
coaches that passed by.’ I have a quaint little
book in Hudibrastic rhyme, ‘The delights of the
Bottle, or the Compleat Vintner,’ attributed to Ned
Ward. The third edition is ‘printed for Sam.
Briscoe at the Bell-Savage on Ludgate-Hill, 1721.’</p>

<p>The Cutlers’, though not one of the twelve
great City Companies, is still of considerable
importance, and as early as the 49th year of
Edward III. is said to have elected two of the
Common Council; its first charter dated from
the time of Henry V. A good sculptured specimen
of the arms is to be seen on the front of a
house in Houndsditch, at the corner of Cutler
Street. They were granted by Thomas Holme.
Clarencieux in 1476, and have been blazoned
thus: gules&mdash;three pair of swords, in saltier,
argent, pommelled and hilted or, viz., two pair
in chief and one in base. The crest should have
by rights pennons displayed from the castle; it
was granted by Robert Cook, Clarencieux. Supporters;
two elephants or; motto: ‘Pour parvenir
a bonne foy.’ The carving referred to above was
put up in the year 1734 to mark property
belonging to the Company, as may be gathered
from the tablet on the west front of the same
house, which is inscribed ‘<span class="smcap">cuttlers’ street</span>, 1734.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>’
The hall of the Cutlers’ Company, rebuilt after
the Great Fire in Cloak Lane, Cannon Street, was
destroyed for the Inner Circle Railway. A new
hall has lately been erected in Warwick Lane.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Another heraldic charge of a City Company is
the Leopard, a carving of which was formerly let
into the front of a house in Budge Row, No. 28. It
was rebuilt about twelve years ago, when the sign
was placed in the passage of the new structure.
The owner has kindly allowed a sketch to be
taken, which is here reproduced. I believe that
the property at one time belonged to the Skinners’
Company, having been part of a bequest of John
Draper, in 1496. The Leopard, though not supported
by a wreath, therefore represents their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
crest. The word ‘budge,’ whence Budge Row
takes its name, formerly signified the dressed
skin or fur of lamb, and would seem to indicate
that furriers carried on their business in this
quarter, near to the Hall of the Skinners’ Company,
which was devoted to the protection of their craft.
In 1338, and again in 1358, the City authorities
ordered that women of inferior rank should not
be arrayed in budge or wool.</p>

<p>One of the commonest London sculptured signs
is that of the Maiden’s Head, which indicates
property belonging to the Mercers’ Company. I
will mention one which is to be seen above the
first-floor window of No. 6, Ironmonger Lane,
with the date 1668, as it is the only specimen of
any antiquity known to me which is dated, and
being somewhat more florid in treatment than
usual, it is characteristic of the time at which it
was put up. The arms of the company, granted
in 1568 and confirmed in 1634, are: gules, a
demi-virgin, with her hair dishevelled, crowned,
issuing out of and within an orle of clouds,
all proper. One may presume from the date
that they were chosen in honour of Queen Elizabeth.
Strype says: ‘When any of this company
is chosen mayor, or makes one of the triumph
of the day, wherein he goes to Westminster to
be sworn, a most beautiful virgin is carried through
the streets in a chariot, with all the glory and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
majesty possible, with her hair all dishevelled
about her shoulders, to represent the maidenhead
which the company give for their arms, and this
lady is plentifully gratified for her pains, besides
the gift of all the rich attire she wears.’ The
Maiden’s Head also appears on the arms of the
Pinners’ Company, with the motto, ‘Virginitas et
unitas nostra æternitas.’ It was assumed as a
badge of the Parr family, previous to the marriage
of Catherine Parr with Henry VIII. They derived
it from the family of Ros of Kendal.</p>

<p>The Mercers’ Company is very ancient; it was
incorporated in the year 1393 (17 Rich. II.);<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
but long before that the mercers had been associated
voluntarily for purposes of mutual aid and
comfort. They came to light first as a fraternity in
the time of Henry II., for Gilbert à Becket, father
of St. Thomas of Canterbury, is said to have been
a mercer; and in 1192, Agnes de Helles, sister
of St. Thomas, and her husband Thomas Fitz-Theobald
de Helles, in founding the hospital of
St. Thomas of Acon, which is distinctly stated to
have been built on the spot where the future
archbishop was born, constituted the fraternity of
mercers patrons of the hospital. The present
Mercers’ Hall, in Cheapside, is built on part of
this site. It was only by degrees that the merchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
adventurers became detached from the mercers.
The last link between the two companies was
severed as late as the year 1666, when the Great
Fire destroyed the office held by the Merchant-Adventurers
under Mercers’ Hall. The Haberdashers’
Company was a branch of the Mercers’,
which broke off from them in the time of
Henry VI. The word ‘mercer’ would seem to
imply merchant only, being derived, through the
French ‘mercier,’ from the Latin word ‘mercator.’
It is probable that those who were called mercers
dealt at first in most commodities, except food and
the precious metals. Herbert, however, considers
that in ancient times ‘mercer’ was the name for a
man who dealt in small wares; and that ‘merceries
then comprehended all things sold retail by
the little balance, in contradistinction to things sold
by the beam, or in gross, and included not only toys,
together with haberdashery and various other articles
connected with dress, but also spices and drugs;
in short, what at present constitutes the stock of
a general country shopkeeper.’ He goes on to
say that the silk trade, which in later ages formed
the main feature of the mercers’ business, is stated
in the Act of 33 Henry VI., c. 5, to have been
carried on by ‘the silkwomen and throwsteres of
London,’ who, in petitioning for that Act, pray
that the Lombards and other strangers may be
hindered from importing wrought silk into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
realm, contrary to custom, and to the ruin of the
mystery and occupation of silk-making and other
virtuous female occupations.</p>

<p>The mercers were not the first incorporated
company; in this the goldsmiths, skinners, and
merchant tailors may claim precedence; they,
however, have long ranked the first, as exemplified
in the following stanzas from a song addressed to
Sir John Peakes, mercer (who was elected Lord
Mayor in 1686), after a dinner given in his
honour:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Advance the Virgin, lead the van,</p>
<p class="pp7">Of all that are in London free,</p>
<p class="pp6">The Mercer is the foremost man</p>
<p class="pp7">That founded a society.</p>
<p class="pp8"><i>Cho.</i> Of all the trades that London grace,</p>
<p class="pp10">We are the first in time and place.</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘When Nature in perfection was,</p>
<p class="pp7">And virgin beauty in her prime,</p>
<p class="pp6">The Mercer gave the nymph a gloss,</p>
<p class="pp7">And made e’en beauty more sublime.</p>
<p class="pp8"><i>Cho.</i> In this above our brethren blest,</p>
<p class="pp10">The Virgin’s since our coat and crest.’</p>

<p class="p1">More or less analogous to the arms of the City
companies are the arms of the Inns of Court and
Chancery. The interesting and highly picturesque
gatehouse of Lincoln’s Inn, facing Chancery Lane,
has on it the date 1518, and three shields. That
in the centre represents the royal arms of England;
to the spectator’s right are the arms of Sir Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Lovell, K.G., who was son of the executor of
King Henry VII., had been reader to the Society
of Lincoln’s Inn, and gave most of the money
required for building the gatehouse.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> To the left
are the arms of Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln,
namely, or, a lion rampant purp., placed there
by the builder; which reminds one of the historic
fact that Lincoln’s Inn stands on the site of the
Earl’s mansion and grounds, once possessed, in part
at least, by the Black or Preaching Friars. Here
he had a fine garden&mdash;so productive that, besides
supplying his table, it yielded, says Mr. Hudson
Turner,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> apples, pears, large nuts, and cherries,
sufficient to produce by their sale in one year
(24 Edward I.) ‘the sum of £9 2s. 3d. in money
of that time, equal to about £135 of modern
currency.’ The Earl of Lincoln died without
male issue in 1312, but bequeathed his name to
the property, which passed into legal hands. His
arms are still retained by the honourable society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
though it has been said that Sir James Lea at one
time proposed another device.</p>

<p>The Winged Horse, or Pegasus, representing the
arms of the Society of the Inner Temple, ornaments
the well-known gatehouse in Fleet Street, which
dates from 1607, and has in front the feathers of
Henry, Prince of Wales, eldest son of James I. A
little west is the gatehouse to the Middle Temple,
built in 1684, from the designs of Sir Christopher
Wren. It has sculptured on it, the Lamb and
Flag, or Agnus Dei:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘As by the Templars’ haunts you go,</p>
<p class="pp7">The Horse and Lamb display’d</p>
<p class="pp6">In emblematic figures show</p>
<p class="pp7">The merits of their trade;</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘That clients may infer from thence</p>
<p class="pp7">How just is their profession,</p>
<p class="pp6">The lamb sets forth their innocence,</p>
<p class="pp7">The horse their expedition.’</p>


<p class="p1">The Winged Horse is supposed by some to be a
corruption of the ancient seal of two Knights
Templars riding on one horse, indicative of their
original poverty; for here they had their headquarters
in England ‘till they decayed through
pride.’ The two designs, however, resemble each
other to a very slight extent, and in point of fact
have no connection. It seems that in the fifth
year of Queen Elizabeth’s reign the Society of
the Inner Temple adopted, as a heraldic charge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the Pegasus with the motto ‘Volat ad æthera
virtus,’ at the suggestion of Gerard Leigh, one of
its Benchers, a pedantic student of heraldry, the
idea being that the knowledge which might be
gained at this seat of learning would raise its
possessor to the highest pinnacle of fame. Sir
George Buc,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> master of the revels, appears to be
responsible for the lamb and flag. He tells us
that in 1615, more than fifty years after the
adoption of the Pegasus by the twin society,
the authorities of the Middle Temple had neither
arms nor seal, and to supply the want he suggested
either ‘two armed knights riding upon one horse,
or a field argent charged with a cross gules, and
on the nombril thereof a Holy Lamb;’ the first
having been, as I have said, the ancient seal of the
Knights Templars, and the second what they appear
to have assumed later, when they became prosperous.
This at least is Sir George Buc’s statement,
on the authority of an illuminated manuscript
containing the statutes of their order, which
belonged to Lord William Howard of Naworth.
Mr. Barrington thought that the Holy Lamb, as
a representation of Christ, should be encircled by
a nimbus. To confirm this view and to prove
that the Templars did use the device, he gives a
quotation from Blomefield’s MS. collections for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Cambridgeshire, wherein the Holy Lamb, with its
nimbus and banner, appears on the seal of a deed
dated 1273, by which Guido de Foresta, ‘magister
militiæ Templi in Anglia et fratres ejusdem
militiæ,’ leased out certain lands in Pampesworth,
Cambridgeshire, the rent to be paid, ‘domino
Templi,’ at Dunworth of the same county. Round
the seal is the following inscription, ‘<span class="large"><span class="cross">✠</span></span> <span class="smcap">sigillvm
templi</span>.’ From the fact that Sir George Buc
suggested to the Society of the Middle Temple
the two devices which had been used by the
Templars, it is evident that the Pegasus, already
adopted by the Inner Temple, was not considered
in his time to have any connection with the original
seal of the Knights Templars.</p>

<p>The fourth of the great Inns of Court&mdash;Gray’s
Inn&mdash;derived its name from the noble family of
the Greys of Wilton, having been originally their
dwelling, just as Lincoln’s Inn had been the
dwelling of an Earl of Lincoln, and several of the
Inns of Chancery were originally the homes of
other well-known personages. The society seems
first to have used the arms of the Grey family;
afterwards they adopted the Griffin’s Head<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> as their
device, and it still adorns the pillars of the gateway
from Field Court into those delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
gardens which were first planted, it is thought,
under the direction of no less a man than Francis
Bacon. Once they were the resort of fine ladies,
but fashion has long since deserted them. The
trees, however, are still fine, the aspect of the
place ‘reverend and law-abiding.’ Here there is,
or was, a rookery, which has given pleasure to
generations of Londoners. Early last summer
(1892) the Benchers, anxious to utilize so eligible
a site, erected a corrugated iron structure some 90
feet long, at the south-west corner of the gardens.
They have tried to make it look beautiful by
partly covering it with trellis-work, and by having
the wooden roof painted tile colour. The rooks,
however, showed their resentment by flying off in
a body, and it remains a question whether they will
again make the gardens their permanent home;
for now I hear that this erection, which has the
negative merit of being easily removable, is to
be replaced by a chapel ‘in the Elizabethan or late
Tudor style,’ the windows to be fitted&mdash;or misfitted&mdash;with
glass from the present chapel, which
will be turned to secular use. A little more than
a century ago Gray’s Inn was quite on the outskirts
of London,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> ‘with an uninterrupted prospect
of the neighbouring fields as far as Highgate and
Hampstead.’</p>

<p>Centuries before the Great Fire, carved shields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of arms were doubtless common in London on
public buildings and the houses of great people, as
decorations, and as guides to the unlettered class,
which then formed a vast majority of the population.
Sometimes&mdash;at any rate, in the earlier days&mdash;these
arms were not carved in stone, but painted
and hung out, as we learn from the evidence
of the poet Chaucer<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> in the Scrope and Grosvenor
dispute, which also gives us an interesting glimpse
of the early history of one of our noble families.
He says that, in walking up Friday Street, he once
saw a sign hung out with ‘arms painted and put
there by a knight of the County of Chester, called
Sir Robert Grosvenor’; and that was the first
time he ever heard of Sir Robert Grosvenor,
or his ancestors, or anyone bearing the name of
Grosvenor.</p>

<p>The first armorial shield to which I shall refer
under this heading is from a public building,
and though comparatively modern it should be
specially interesting to all citizens of London. I
allude to the Royal Arms<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>&mdash;a well-executed piece
of sculpture&mdash;which is used as the sign of a public-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
rebuilt quite recently, on the south side of
Newcomen Street, late King Street, Southwark.
This was taken from the gatehouse at the Southwark
end of old London Bridge, which was pulled down
in 1760, in consequence of an Act of Parliament
passed four years previously, for the destruction of
the buildings on London Bridge and the widening
of the roadway.</p>

</div>

<p>King Street was then being made
from High Street to Snow Fields, through the
former Axe and Bottle Yard, and these arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
having been bought by Mr. Williams, a stonemason
who was employed in the construction of
King Street, were placed by him more or less in
their present position. In a view of the bridgegate
engraved for Noorthouck’s ‘History of
London’ (p. 543), the arms appear with the inscription,
<span class="smcap">g ii r</span>, afterwards changed to <span class="smcap">g iii</span>, as
we now see it.</p>

<p>There are still a few carved shields of arms in
London, dating from the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, which marked the property of private
individuals. Until quite recently the district
known as Cloth Fair and Bartholomew Close, in
the immediate neighbourhood of the Church of St.
Bartholomew the Great, was distinguished by its air
of picturesque antiquity. Some quaint old houses
still remain; on one of them&mdash;No. 22, Cloth Fair&mdash;is
to be seen a relic which carries us back almost
to the time of the dissolution of the monasteries.
This is the armorial shield of Richard Rich, who
was made a peer in 1547; or more likely, perhaps,
of one of his immediate descendants. It is surmounted
by a coronet, and has been blazoned
thus: gules, a chevron between three crosses
botonnée or.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The founder of the Rich family
was a mercer in the City, and Sheriff in the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
1442; it was his great-grandson Richard who,
<i>temp.</i> Henry VIII., became Solicitor-General,
Speaker of the House of Commons, and who
took so scandalous a part in the trial and conviction
of Sir Thomas More. In 1544 the site of
St. Bartholomew’s Priory was granted by the King
to his favourite, there described as Sir Richard
Rich, knight, in consideration of the sum of
£1,064 11s. 3d., as appears from the original
deed; and here he is said to have lived in the
Prior’s mansion as Lord Chancellor. The tolls of
the fair<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> were also granted to him. It was provided
that the church within the Great Close
was to be a parish church for ever, and vacant
ground adjoining it on the west side, 87 feet in
length by 60 feet in breadth, where the destroyed
nave had stood, was to be taken for a churchyard,
the site of the fair being no longer used as a
burial-ground.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Rich was made a baron in 1547.
Queen Mary revoked the grant in his favour, and
placed here a convent of Preaching Friars, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
under Father Person began to rebuild the nave
of the church, but they were turned out when
Elizabeth came to the throne, and the following
year there was a fresh grant to the purchaser, by
the title of Richard Lord Rich, and his heirs, ‘in
free socage.’ The monastery with its precincts
had been enclosed by a wall which contained,
besides the numerous monastic offices, a large
garden and court, fifty-one tenements, a mulberry
garden (one of the first planted in this country),
and the famous churchyard wherein had been
held, since the time of Henry I., the great annual
gathering for clothiers and drapers. This began
to fall off, as a cloth fair,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> towards the end of the
sixteenth century, but continued to be more or
less of a London carnival, and in some sort
lingered on as late as the year 1855. The first
Lord Rich died in 1560; during his lifetime
little building seems to have taken place, for in
Ralph Aggas’s map, which is considered to be
of about this date, the space north of the church
has no houses upon it, and the priory wall abutting
on Long Lane still exists. Very soon, however,
the land was turned to more profitable account, and
we find Stow<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> writing at the end of the century:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
‘Now notwithstanding all proclamations of the
prince, and also the Act of Parliament, in place of
booths within this churchyard (only let out in the
fair time, and closed up all the year after), be many
large houses built, and the north wall towards
Long Lane taken down, a number of tenements
are there erected for such as will give great rents.’
The houses in the street now called Cloth Fair
probably followed the old line of booths. The
first Lord Rich’s grandson Robert, who made
such an ill-assorted marriage with Lady Penelope
Devereux, Sidney’s ‘Stella,’ was raised to the dignity
of Earl of Warwick in 1618. His second son
Henry was created Baron Kensington and Earl of
Holland. The titles were merged in the next
generation, and became extinct in the year 1759,
when the tolls of the fair descended to the
Edwardes family, cousins of the Riches, in whose
favour the Kensington title was revived. Lord
Kensington sold these tolls to the Corporation of
London in 1839.</p>

<p>Before we quit this quaint neighbourhood let
us peep into the venerable Church of St. Bartholomew
the Great. What an idea it gives one
of the splendour of the old priory church, of
which it formed but a part, little more than
the choir remaining! Much ‘restoration’ is in
progress here, and it is difficult at a glance to
distinguish between the genuine Norman work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and the ingenious nineteenth-century Norman
which has lately been added. Fortunately the
fine perpendicular oriel on the south side of the
triforium has so far escaped intact. It was probably
inserted by Prior Bolton (who died in 1532),
and has on it, carved in stone, expressive of his
name, a tun pierced by a bird-bolt, or arrow.
The rebus occurs again on the spandrel of a
Tudor doorway which leads into the modern
vestry. This Prior seems to have taken pleasure
in building, and in seeing his name thus perpetuated.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
He reconstructed the manor-house of
Canonbury, Islington, north of the parish church,
which had been given to the convent by Ralph de
Berners, and as early as the year 1253 is enumerated
among his possessions. Here is also to
be found the Prior’s rebus, on a doorway inside
No. 6, Canonbury Place, which, with No. 7, is
now used for a girls’ school. It also formerly
appeared cut in stone on two parts of the wall
originally connected with the old brick tower,
which is so picturesque and so full of interesting
associations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, however, generally thought that the
tower, as we see it, was built under the direction
of Sir John Spencer, the wealthy merchant, afterwards
the purchaser of Crosby Hall, who bought
this place from Thomas Lord Wentworth in
1570. Eleven years afterwards Queen Elizabeth
visited him here, and towards the end of the
century he made great alterations in the building.
Two of the rooms attached to Canonbury Tower
are finely panelled from floor to ceiling; the
very handsome carved chimney-piece in the upper
room bears the arms of Sir John Spencer.
Canonbury House is now occupied by a Constitutional
Club. Parts of the building have been
modernized of late years, but the panelled rooms
are still much in their original state. The pretty
strip of garden at the back contains fruit-trees
which Goldsmith may have seen, when he lodged
here in the summer of 1767.</p>

<p>We must not forget that the original building
occupied a considerable part of Canonbury Place.
We have evidence of this in Prior Bolton’s rebus
at No. 6; and traces of Sir John Spencer’s work
are to be seen in this and the adjoining houses,
where there are no less than five richly-stuccoed
ceilings, two of them with the date 1599. Here
also, inside the entrance, are the arms<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> of Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Walter Dennys, carved in oak. They were formerly
over a fireplace, and when moved to their
present position, many years ago, the following
inscription was placed underneath:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘These were the arms of Sir Walter Dennys of Gloucestershire,
who was made a Knight by bathing at the creation of
Arthur, Prince of Wales in Nov. 1489, and died Sept. 1,
21 Henry VII., and was buried at the church of Olviston in
Gloucestershire. He married Margaret, daughter of Sir
Rich Weston, Knt., to which family Canonbury House formerly
belonged. The carving is therefore 280 years old.’</p>

<p class="p1">The latter part of the inscription is clearly erroneous,
as the manor-house was not in lay hands till
after the dissolution. Mr. Nelson thought that
these arms were placed here by some descendant of
the Dennys or Weston family, who might afterwards
have lived at Canonbury&mdash;perhaps one of
the Comptons, Joan, a daughter of Sir Walter,
having married into that family. The Comptons
did not come into possession till 1610, when William,
the second lord, succeeded Sir John Spencer,
having married Elizabeth, his daughter and sole
heiress. I need hardly say that they were the
direct ancestors of the present Marquis of Northampton,
who still owns the property.</p>

<p>A famous galleried inn, the Old Bell,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Holborn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
now almost unique of its kind, has, imbedded in the
front, the sculptured arms of Fowler of Islington,
namely, azure, on a chevron argent, between
three herons or, as many crosses formée gules.
They are surmounted by an esquire’s helmet, with
a crest, which seems to be an eagle’s head with
a sprig of some sort in its beak. The first man
of this family who made any mark was Thomas
Fowler, lord of the manor of Bernersbury<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> or
Barnsbury, Islington, in 1548. From him descended
Sir Thomas Fowler, knight, Deputy Lieutenant of
the county of Middlesex, and apparently one of the
jurors at the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, at Winchester,
in 1603. If the tradition of Sir Walter’s
residence at Islington is true, they must have lived
within a stone’s throw of each other at one time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Before being knighted, Thomas Fowler had married
Jane, daughter of Gregory Charlet, citizen and
tallow-chandler, who bore him two sons. His
second wife, to whom he was married at St. James’s
Church, Clerkenwell, on March 17, 1604, was
Mary, widow of Sir John Spencer, of Althorp&mdash;not
to be confused with his neighbour the rich
merchant of Crosby Place and Canonbury, who
lived on till 1609. His elder son, also Thomas,
was made a baronet, but the title died out with
him in 1656.</p>

<p>The Fowlers dwelt in a house in Cross Street,
Islington, a little beyond the church, which still
existed a generation ago. The ceiling of a room
on the first-floor was decorated with the arms and
initials of Queen Elizabeth, also the initials <span class="smcap">f t i</span>. At
the end of the garden, which had been of considerable
extent, there was a small brick building,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
intended, perhaps, for a summer-house or porter’s
lodge. It had on the west side, cut in stone, the
Fowler arms, bearing an esquire’s helmet, apparently
similar in all respects to those I have
described, except that no mention is made of a
crest. In another part of the building were the
arms of Sir Thomas Fowler the younger, with his
initials and the date 1655. They were distinguished
by having an escutcheon charged with a sinister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
hand, couped at the wrist&mdash;the arms of Ulster
and ensign of baronetcy. It is curious that the
daughter and heiress of this Sir Thomas Fowler
married a Fisher, to whom descended the manor of
Barnsbury, and that the first Fowler who settled
in Islington had married a Herne or Heron. The
arms of that family appeared in a window of the
old house in Cross Street.</p>

<p>When visiting the Guildhall Museum, not long
since, I was reminded of another Islington family,
not distinguished, but still perhaps worthy of
mention. A stone tablet, said to be from an old
house in Upper Street, Islington, has on it the
inscription:  <span class="smcap"><sub>n</sub><sup>r</sup><sub>i</sub> rvffords bvildings</span> 1688,
and a similar inscription is still to be seen on
No. 1a, Compton Street, Clerkenwell. The fact
is, there were two groups of houses thus named,
both of which were built by Captain Nicholas
Rufford, who was churchwarden at Islington in
1690, and died in 1711, aged seventy-one. Nelson
mentions inscriptions to him and several of his
family in the churchyard. In the Islington
Rufford’s Buildings Dr. W. Berriman lived for
some years. He was a famous divine, and became
Fellow of Eton College. His death took place in
1749-50.</p>

<p>Some pages back, in my description of the sign
of the Two Negroes’ Heads, I had occasion to
allude to Clare Market. Before that neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
is quite transformed, I should like to say a few
words about it and its connection with the Holles
family. An old coat of arms and an old inscription
will serve as pegs on which to hang my story.
In Seymour’s ‘Survey,’ 1754 (written by John
Mottley), we are told that Clement’s Inn<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>&mdash;the
fancied scene of Shallow’s exploits&mdash;descended to
the Earls of Clare from their ancestor Sir William
Holles, or Hollis&mdash;as he spells it&mdash;Lord Mayor
of London in 1539. The name of John, Baron
Holles of Houghton, appears as a parishioner of
St. Clement Danes in the rate-book for the year
1617. In 1624 he was created Earl of Clare.
There seems to have been no concealment about
the fact that his titles were bought: the first,
obtained through the influence of the Duke of
Buckingham, had cost him no less a sum than
£10,000; for the second he is said to have paid
an additional £5,000. It is curious that this latter
dignity had some years before been refused to
Robert Rich, afterwards created Earl of Warwick,
who had set his heart on it (and is said to have also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
paid money for his earldom), the Crown lawyers
having solemnly declared that it was a title peculiar
to the Royal Family, and not to be borne by a subject.
The princely mansion of John Holles,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
second Earl, was at the end of Clare Court, or
Clare House Court, on the east side of Drury
Lane, next to Blackmore Street. In Hatton’s
time (1708) it had been turned into tenements.
This second Earl founded Clare Market,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which
stands, or stood, on what was previously called
Clement’s Inn Fields. License had already been
granted by Charles I. to Thomas York in 1640,
and to the antiquary Gervase Holles<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> in 1642,
to make streets and to erect houses on this
property. One of the provisions in the Act<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
passed in 1657, ‘for the Preventing of the
Multiplicity of Buildings in and about the
Suburbs of London,’ expressly states that John,
Earl of Clare, having erected several new buildings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and improved the property, ‘from henceforth for
ever hereafter, on every Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday, in every week, there shall be a common
open and free market, held in Clement’s Inn Fields
aforesaid, where the said buildings useful for a
market are erected, and in the places near unto
adjoining, and to enjoy all liberties, customs and
emoluments incident usually and of right belonging
and appertaining to markets.’ It seems, from
the ‘Harleian Miscellany,’ that the City authorities
at one time began a lawsuit laying claim to this
property, but they failed in their attempt. The
market was at first usually called the New
Market.</p>

<p>The streets in this neighbourhood are several
of them named after the family of the former
possessors: as Clare Street, where, on Saturdays,
there is still something like a market; Denzell
Street, Holles Street, Houghton Street, Vere Street,
and Gilbert Street and Passage. On a squalid house
at the corner of this narrow opening, and facing the
space lately cleared in what was the market, I have
observed with interest a fine stone bas-relief of the
Holles arms, surmounted by an earl’s coronet,
namely, ermine, two piles in point sable, and
the motto ‘Spes audaces adjuvat,’ the supporters
being a lion and that nondescript beast, a
heraldic tiger, which is supposed to have a
dragon’s head. The date beneath is 1659, showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
that they were put up for John Holles, second
Earl of Clare, no doubt on a building in the
market-place. Another curious relic is to be
seen let into the wall of a public-house called the
Royal Yacht, at the corner of Denzell Street and
Stanhope Street. This is a stone tablet, the inscription
on which is here given, and which speaks
for itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-150.jpg" width="350" height="391" id="i150"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>It was erected by Gilbert, third Earl, in memory
of his father’s second brother Denzil&mdash;‘a man of
great courage and of as great pride,’ says Clarendon,
who, during the early troubles between
Charles I. and his Parliament, took a leading part
on the popular side. On March 2, 1629, when
the Speaker was about to adjourn the House in
obedience to the King’s order, Denzil Holles
helped to keep him in the chair by force, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
which conduct he, with five other members, was
committed to the Tower and fined 1,000 marks.
After many vicissitudes Holles welcomed the restoration
of Charles II., was created a peer, and sent
as Ambassador to Paris, where his pugnacity and
his ignorance of the French language<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> were alike
remarkable. Mr. Wheatley tells us that in 1644
he had been living in Covent Garden, under the
name of Colonel Holles; in 1666, and after, he
was in a house at the west corner of the north
piazza, which Sir Kenelm Digby had previously
occupied.</p>

<p>The Holles family became extinct in the male
line on the death of John, fourth Earl of Clare,
who had married Lady Margaret Cavendish, a
great heiress, and was created Duke of Newcastle.
This nobleman, one of the richest
subjects in the kingdom, died in 1711, from
the effects of a fall while hunting at Welbeck,
leaving an only daughter, from whom is descended
the present Duke of Portland. Some years before
his death, namely, in May, 1705, still clinging to
the neighbourhood with which his family had been
so long connected, the last Holles in the male line
bought from the Marquis of Powis, for the large
sum of £7,000, the house at the north-west angle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of Lincoln’s Inn Fields, now numbered 66 and 67,
which touches Great Queen Street, and is still
known as Powis or Newcastle House. The Duke
left the greater part of his possessions, including
this house, to his nephew, Thomas Pelham, the
well-known political leader in the time of
George II., who took the name of Holles, and was
also created Duke of Newcastle. Here he lived
and intrigued, and this was the scene of his levees,
so graphically described by Lord Chesterfield. If
those silent walls could speak, they might tell us
many strange tales.</p>

<p>Newcastle House had been built in 1686 by
Captain William Winde, or Wynne, as Campbell
calls him in the ‘Vitruvius Britannicus’&mdash;a pupil
of Gerbier, and perhaps also of Webb, who was in
his turn a pupil of Inigo Jones. The structure
has unfortunately been much altered for the
worse since an engraving of it was made for
Strype’s Stow (edition of 1754). It replaced an
older house which had been burnt to the ground
on October 26, 1684, the family escaping with
difficulty. William Herbert, first Marquis and
titular Duke of Powis, for whom the house was
built, suffered severely owing to his attachment to
the cause of James II. He accompanied the King
into exile, his estates were, in part at any rate, confiscated,
and he died at St. Germains in 1696. In
some way this house escaped the general wreck;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
perhaps it was alienated for a few years. Strype
says that ‘it was sometime the seat of Sir John
Somers, late Lord Chancellor of England’; and
Pennant adds, ‘It is said that Government had it
once in contemplation to have bought and settled
it officially on the great seal. At that time it was
inhabited by the Lord Keeper, Sir Nathan Wright.’
Whatever the circumstances may have been, it
came into the hands of the second Marquis, who
before its sale to the Duke of Newcastle had
already built himself another house<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> in Great
Ormond Street, on the site of which is Powis
Place.</p>

<p>The west side of Lincoln’s Inn Fields shows
interesting specimens of architecture. Lindsey
House, though much altered, is an undoubted
work of Inigo Jones. It was built probably about
the year 1640, for Robert Bertie, first Earl of
Lindsey, who died a hero’s death at the battle of
Edgehill. The fourth Earl having been created
Duke of Ancaster, it was for a time called
Ancaster House. Hatton, in 1708, describes it as
‘a handsome building of the Ionic order, and (in
front a) strong beautiful court-gate, consisting of six
fine, spacious brick piers, with curious ironwork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
between them, and on the piers are placed very
large and beautiful vases.’ The stone facade is now
plastered and painted, the entrance door widened,
the house divided into two. Inside, a graceful
mantelpiece and an alcove evidently belong to the
last century. Mr. Alfred Marks, in a valuable
note on the house, ascribes these architectural
features to Ware, who was a great admirer of Inigo
Jones, and in 1743 published some of his designs.
The alcove is adorned by a coat of arms belonging
to the Shiffner family, a member of which, as
appears from the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, resided in
Lincoln’s Inn Fields in the year 1759.</p>

<p>South of Lindsey House, there are other buildings
which were probably designed by Inigo Jones.
From the house which is over the archway leading
into Sardinia Street, one may trace the Rose and
Fleur-de-lys of Charles I. and his Queen on the
pilasters. They are now mostly plastered and
painted, but it may be remarked that in the extreme
south-west corner of the Fields, behind other
more modern structures, stands a house the upper
part of which is outside in its original condition.
It is of red brick, the bases, bands and capitals of
the pilasters and the architraves being of stone, and
it has, like the others, the rose and fleur-de-lys in
relief. But the best-preserved specimen, externally,
of work of this character now existing in London
is the harmonious red-brick building on the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
side of Great Queen Street, hard by, which was
either designed by Inigo Jones or by Webb under
his influence. Let those who wish to study its
fine proportions and pleasant details lose no time,
for an ominous board has appeared in front, and
much I fear that its days are numbered. Can
nothing be done to save it? Mr. Wheatley says
that Thomas Hudson, the portrait-painter (Reynolds’s
master), lived in this house, which is now
divided and numbered 55 and 56. It had almost
certainly been occupied by Sir Godfrey Kneller.</p>

<p class="pch">MISCELLANEOUS SIGNS, DATES, AND INSCRIPTIONS,
ETC.</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Many things of worthy memory.’</p>

<p class="pr12 reduct"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>: <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap00">I SHALL close my account with a few miscellaneous
signs and inscriptions which I
could not appropriately fit in elsewhere. Several
eminent banking firms carefully preserve the signs
which were used by them before their houses were
numbered; but they have been so ably described
by Mr. Hilton Price and others, that little more
need be said. The Marygold is in the front
shop of Messrs. Child and Co.’s premises, Fleet
Street; it is of oak, the ground stained green,
with a sun and a gilt border: the motto underneath
is, ‘Ainsi mon âme.’ The Three Squirrels of
Messrs. Gosling are worked in iron and attached
to the bars which protect their central window,
and the original sign of copper is preserved in the
front office. From Mr. Price I learn that as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
early as the year 1684, and perhaps earlier, James
Chambers kept a goldsmith’s shop at the Three
Squirrels over against St. Dunstan’s Church, Fleet
Street; and it is a curious fact that one family of
Chambers bears the three squirrels in its arms.
Hoare’s Golden Bottle hangs over the doorway of
their banking-house. Sir Richard Colt Hoare
thought it was a barrel sign adopted by James
Hore, of Cheapside, because his father, Ralph, was
a member of the Coopers’ Company. More likely,
however, it was a sign of the same description as
the Black Jack and the Leathern Bottle, of which
a genuine specimen from the corner of Charles
Street, Leather Lane, has lately found its way into
the Guildhall Museum. Unfortunately, the Grasshopper&mdash;the
old sign of Messrs. Martin and Co., in
Lombard Street&mdash;has not been preserved. It was
the crest of Sir Thomas Gresham, who is believed
to have here carried on his business. A most
interesting history of the house has lately been
written by Mr. J. B. Martin, one of the
partners. A quaint and charming sign is the
little carved figure of a naval officer taking an
observation&mdash;the Wooden Midshipman of Dombey
and Son. He may still be seen in the Minories,
having migrated from Leadenhall Street some
years ago. Not long since the owners sent him
for change of air to the Naval Exhibition. The
figure and its associations form the subject of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
capital paper by Mr. J. Ashby-Sterry in <i>All the
Year Round</i> for October 29, 1881.</p>

<p>At the corner of Charlotte Street and the Blackfriars
Road there is a figure of a dog overturning
a three-legged iron pot, in its eagerness to get at
the contents; this is the sign of a wholesale ironmonger’s
establishment said to date from 1783.
The Dog’s Head in the Pot, as it is called, seems,
of late years at any rate, to have been usually
adopted by members of this trade, because the
vessel represented is of iron. The sign is said to
indicate a dirty, slovenly housewife. Larwood and
Hotten mention a coarse woodcut of the beginning
of last century (to judge from the costumes, copied
from an older original) which represents two old
women in a disorderly room or kitchen. One of
them wipes a plate with the bushy tail of a large
dog whose head is buried in a pot. Under it are
the lines:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘All sluts behold, take view of me,<br />
Your own good husbandry to see.’</p>

<p class="p1">A Dutch saying, to anyone late for dinner, is
that he will find the dog in the pot; in other
words, that the remains of the dinner have been
handed over to the dog to finish.</p>

<p>The Dog’s Head in the Pot is a very old
London sign, being mentioned in a tract from
the press of Wynkyn de Worde called ‘Cocke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Lorell’s Bote.’ The person who dwelt at this
sign was therein described as ‘Annys Angry with
the croked buttock&mdash;by her crafte a breche maker.’
A later notice occurs in the will (dated September 3,
1563) of Thomas Johnson, citizen and haberdasher,
of London, who gave £13 4s. annually to the highways
between Barkway and Dog’s Head in the
Pot, otherwise called ‘Horemayd,’ probably a
house of entertainment in the parish of Great or
Little Hormead, in Hertfordshire, by the side of
the road from Barkway to London. At a house
in Westgate Street, Gloucester, some beautifully
carved Tudor panels have lately come to light.
One of them has on it a dog or leopard eating out
of a three-legged pot. A seventeenth-century
trade-token, issued from Red Cross Street, and
another from Old Street, St. Luke’s, have the device
of the Dog’s Head in the Pot.</p>

<p>A medallion in plaster or terra-cotta, which
looked as if it might have been copied from a
classical coin, was till lately to be seen on the gable
of a little fishmonger’s shop in Cheyne Walk.
This, though a humble specimen of its class, belonged
to a style of decoration once common. I
have before me a view, dated 1792, of a house on
Tower Hill with similar medallions. Sometimes
the heads of Roman Emperors were thus placed,
sometimes the cardinal virtues or other emblematic
figures. In the third edition of Stow, by Anthony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Munday, occurs the following passage, descriptive
of Aldgate: ‘The old ruinous Gate being taken
downe, and order provided for a new foundation,
divers very ancient peeces of Romane coyne were
found among the stones and rubbish, which, as Mr.
Martin Bond (a Worshipful Citizen, and one of the
Surveyors of the worke) told me, two of them
(according to their true forme and figure) he caused
to be carved on stone, and fixed on eyther side of
the Gates Arch without, eastward.’ These coins
were of the Emperors Trajan and Diocletian.
Martin Bond laid the foundation-stone of the new
gate in 1607. The little house in Cheyne Walk was
formerly a freehold with the right of pasturage on
Chelsea Common; it was pulled down in October,
1892. I have drawn it for the frontispiece of this
volume; the lower part appears in a delightful
etching by Whistler, called ‘The Fish-shop.’</p>

<p>One of the most interesting signs in existence
belongs to my friend Mr. F. Manley Sims. It does
not, however, strictly belong to London, having
been brought from Poole some years ago; its earlier
history has yet to be discovered. This is a doctor’s
signboard, excellently carved, with figures in high
relief. It is divided into compartments: in the
centre&mdash;more important than the rest&mdash;is the
doctor himself, in Jacobean costume, his potions
ranged on shelves behind him; around, in seven
compartments, are represented various operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of surgery; and below, in relief, appear the words
from Ecclesiasticus, ‘Altissimus creavit de terra
medicynam et vir prudens non abhorebit illam.’
Anno Domini 1623. There are traces of paint
and gilding; the whole is enclosed within an ornamental
border, and has a highly decorative effect.</p>

<p>Somewhat akin to the sculptured street signs
are the tablets on which are inscribed the names
of the streets, and often the dates of their building
or completion. They have historical value where,
as is not unfrequently the case, they record a name
now in danger of being forgotten, and some of
them are designed with a good deal of taste. So
many of these tablets remain that I shall not
attempt a list, but shall only mention a few
good examples. One of the oldest is in Great
Chapel Street, Westminster, and is inscribed:
‘This is Chappeil Street, 1656.’</p>

<p>The following are instances of the inscriptions,
which may help us to make out the history of the
streets. On a corner house at the east side of
Dering Street (late Union Street), Oxford Street,
is a stone inscribed, ‘Sheffield Street, 1721.’
Curiously enough, in Horwood’s Map of 1799,
and in another issued in 1800, the name is given
as Shepherd Street, so that here we have four
changes in 170 years. On a modern house at the
south-east corner of Danvers Street, Cheyne Walk,
much of which is now cleared away, there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
stone, supported by brackets, with a pediment
which tells us that ‘This is Danvers Street, begun
in y<sup>e</sup> year 1696 by Benjamin Stallwood.’ Danvers
House, hard by, was not pulled down till 1716.
May’s Buildings, on the east side of St. Martin’s
Lane, have the name, and date 1739. Mr. J. T.
Smith, in ‘Nollekens and his Times,’ tells us that
they were built by Mr. May, who ornamented the
front of No. 43, St. Martin’s Lane, a few doors off,
where he resided. His house is still there; it has
pretty cut brick pilasters, and a cornice, and is now
used as a restaurant. The archway which leads into
Sardinia Street, under one of the old houses on the
west side of Lincoln’s Inn Fields, is inscribed above
the keystone on each side, ‘Duke Streete, 1648.’
This street was renamed in 1878, after the chapel
there, once belonging to the Sardinian minister,
which was demolished in the riots of June 2, 1780,
but shortly afterwards rebuilt, and is now known
as the chapel of SS. Anselm and Cecilia. Here
Fanny Burney was married, in 1793, to General
D’Arblay. A stone tablet, which has on it ‘Nassau
Street in Whettens Buildings, 1734,’ is still to
be seen at the south-west corner of Nassau Street.
In Strype’s Map of 1720 the ground here, facing
Gerrard Street, is occupied by a large mansion with
a garden at the back, Nassau Street not being yet
made.</p>

<p>Some of these tablets are well designed; a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
nice example, though not an early one, is placed
above the first-floor of No. 16, Great James Street,
Bedford Row. It is an irregular convex shield,
surrounded by elaborate scroll-work of a style not
uncommon about the time of its erection, namely,
in 1721. As a typical specimen it has been drawn
for this work. James Street, Haymarket, is also
marked by a stone with ornamental border, above
a first-floor window of what is left of the old
Tennis Court, which is said to have been connected
with the noted Gaming House and Shaver’s Hall.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The date on it&mdash;namely, 1673, indicates, I suppose,
the year in which the street was built or finished;
Shaver’s Hall existed some time previously. The
Tennis Court ceased to be used in 1866, to the
regret of many. In the year 1887 the upper part
was rebuilt; but from the tablet downwards the
original walls, though stuccoed over, remain.
Mr. Julian Marshall says that in this court Charles
and the Duke of York used frequently to play their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
favourite game, and that the house, No. 17, at the
south-western corner of James’s Street and the
Haymarket, is said to have been that through
which the royal brothers used to pass, on their
way to the Tennis Court.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> It does not, however,
appear that there was any contemporary evidence
connecting them with it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>In the region called Mount Pleasant, Gray’s Inn
Lane, not far from the new thoroughfare Rosebery
Avenue, there are two or three tablets of a
different kind. Near the west end, between Nos. 55
and 56, is a plain square stone, with ‘<span class="smcap">dorrington
street</span> 1720’ incised in Roman capitals. This
stone is in a brick frame, with moulded hood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and projects from the frame about an inch and a
half. Further east, on No. 41, nearly opposite the
site of the prison, are two more tablets; one,
similar to that just described, has ‘<span class="smcap">baynes street</span>,
1737.’ Over this is a far more elaborate example
of cut or moulded brick, with a pediment. It has
the inscription ‘<span class="smcap">in god is all our trust</span>,’ and
below some marks or signs in relief (one of which
appears to be a T-square), with the date 1737.
The motto is similar to that of the Brewers’
Company, and of the Tylers’ and Bricklayers’
Company; with the latter I should think that the
builder or first possessor may have had some connection.</p>

<p>This last, being a house and not a street
tablet, reminds me that there are scattered about
here and there on the fronts of houses, initials
and dates which by judicious treatment are made
quite decorative. One of the prettiest was a
little cut brick tablet on an old house&mdash;No. 164,
Union Street, Southwark&mdash;lately destroyed, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
had on it beneath a pediment the initials <span class="smcap">w. h.</span> in
monogram, and the date 1701. Again, in Walbrook,
on the west side, is a tablet merely dated 1668, with
well-designed brackets and cornice. On a modern
house&mdash;No. 4, Tothill Street, Westminster&mdash;called
in 1885 the Cock, now the Aquarium Tavern,
there is a stone on which are cut the date 1671,
a heart-shaped mark, and the initials <span class="smcap">e. t. a.</span></p>

<p>In 1850, when Peter Cunningham wrote his handbook,
the old house was yet standing; in it Thomas
Southerne, the poet, had lodged, as pointed out
by Mr. Hutton in his ‘Literary Landmarks of
London.’ The heart has puzzled me; a similar
mark was formerly on a house in Peter Street,
Westminster. Can it have been a parish mark?
An undoubted device of this kind appears on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
house at the corner of West Street and Upper St.
Martin’s Lane, and consists of two ragged staves
crossed, with the date 1691, and the initials <span class="smcap">s. g. f.</span>,
which indicate the parish of St. Giles’s in the
Fields. A mark of the parish of St. Bride’s, dated
1670, is in Robin Hood Court, Shoe Lane. At
the corner of Artillery Street, Bishopsgate Without,
and Sandys Row, soon to be improved away, there is
a flat stone having fastened on it a piece of iron,
shaped like a broad arrow, and below the date
1682. Is this a parish mark, or can it have been
connected in any way with the old artillery
ground&mdash;the Tassel Close of an earlier time, when
crossbow-makers used here to shoot at the popinjay?
In Strype’s time ‘divers worthy citizens’
still frequented it for martial exercise. Of greater
historic interest are the monogram of Henry VIII.,
the Tudor portcullis, and other devices carved on
the spandrels of the arches which are under the
gatehouse of St. James’s Palace.</p>

<p>A general description of the painted signboards
of London has formed no part of the
scheme of this book, because much has already
been written on the subject, and it would
be too extensive to treat satisfactorily in the
limited space at my command. It may, however,
be useful to note a few signs of this
kind still <i>in situ</i>. The Running Footman, of
which there are two specimens in Hays Mews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Charles Street, Berkeley Square, is particularly
interesting on account of the costume, and because
it is a record of the days when carriages moved at
little more than a foot’s pace,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and there were no
police to regulate the traffic. It is supposed to
date from about 1770. Such a servant as this
would be singularly out of place in modern London;
but in the East, retainers of the same kind, who run
in front and clear the way, still naturally form part
of a great man’s equipage. The Goat in Boots is
to be seen in the Fulham Road in front of a public-house
lately rebuilt. To Le Blond&mdash;a Flemish
painter, who lived at Chelsea&mdash;was attributed the
original design, which seems to have been painted
or repainted by Morland. Since then, however, it
has been daubed over again and again. Some ingenious
person has conjectured that the sign originated
from a corruption of the Dutch words: ‘der
Goden Bode’ (the messenger of the Gods), said to
have been applied to Mercury, and to have been
formerly used on houses in Holland, to denote that
post-horses were to be obtained; but this seems
improbable, as the house in old deeds is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the Goat. At the Ben Jonson tavern in Shoe
Lane a curious old wooden panel is preserved,
which bears on its two sides what are supposed
to be portraits of ‘rare Ben’; as it is nailed against
the wall, one side only is now visible. The person
portrayed is a lean hungry-looking man, the very
reverse of the poet; it seems likely, nevertheless,
that this was the old signboard. A more ambitious
effort is the full-length portrait of the Duke
of Cumberland&mdash;the hero of Culloden&mdash;which
is on a public-house at the corner of Bryanston
Street and Great Cumberland Place, built about
1774. It is affixed to the wall in accordance with
the law passed a short time previously. One is
reminded of a letter by Horace Walpole to
Conway, dated April 16, 1747, in which he thus
moralizes: ‘I observed how the Duke of Cumberland’s
head had succeeded, almost universally, to
Admiral Vernon’s, as his head had left few traces
of the Duke of Ormonde’s. I pondered these
things in my heart, and said unto myself all glory
is but a sign.’ Now that Hatchett’s Hotel in
Piccadilly has passed away, it is worth while to
record that over the bar of the Restaurant on this
site (rebuilt 1886) was to be seen the old painted
signboard of a white horse with flowing mane and
tail, and the inscription, ‘The New White Horse
Cellars, Abraham Hatchett.’ Last year, owing to
further alterations, this was removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>The signs I have referred to are comparatively
well known, but that of the Coach and Horses&mdash;No.
49, St. John’s Square, Clerkenwell&mdash;has, I
think, hitherto escaped observation. This is a
large picture representing a lioness attacking one
of the leaders of a mail-coach; a yokel with
a pitchfork, and a dog, advance intrepidly to the
rescue. In the background is a wayside inn, in
front a pond. The event depicted actually took
place on October 20, 1816, and is described in
‘Cassell’s Popular Natural History,’ vol. ii., p. 119.
It seems that the Exeter mail-coach was on its
way to London, and the driver had pulled up at
Winter’s-Low-Hut, seven miles from Salisbury,
to deliver the bags, when one of his leaders was
suddenly attacked by a ferocious animal, which
proved to be a lioness. A large mastiff came to
the rescue, but when she charged him he fled, and
was pursued and killed about forty yards from
where the coach was standing. It turned out
that the lioness had escaped from a menagerie
which was on its way to Salisbury Fair. She was
eventually driven into a granary, carrying the
dead mastiff in her teeth, and there secured by her
keepers. A picture of this strange attack was
long exhibited at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly;
of this picture I imagine the sign to be a copy, it
seems too well done to have been painted expressly
for the public-house to which it belongs. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
course of 1889 a curious sign, the Whistling
Oyster, disappeared from No. 13, Vinegar Yard,
on the south side of Drury Lane Theatre. Here
were formerly oyster and refreshment rooms, and
it seems that about 1840 Mr. Pearkes, the then
proprietor, discovered among his stock an eccentric
bivalve, which actually did produce a sort of
whistling sound; much custom for a time and many
jokes resulting therefrom. In an early volume of
<i>Punch</i> there is a fancy portrait of the whistling oyster.</p>

<p>In the course of this work I have several times
alluded to the Guildhall Museum, beneath the
Guildhall Library, which is not known as it
deserves. It contains not only sculptured signs,
but a very valuable collection of objects of artistic
and antiquarian interest, most of them from various
parts of the city. The only drawbacks are that
the crypt or room in which they are placed, being
half underground, is very imperfectly lighted,
and that the collection has not hitherto been
catalogued. This latter defect will, however,
I understand, be shortly remedied. Before descending
let us glance at the statues which flank
the entrance to the Guildhall Library and Museum
from King Street. They are from the old College
of Physicians in Warwick Lane&mdash;one of Wren’s
buildings&mdash;some remains of which still exist, incorporated
in the premises at the back of No. 1, Newgate
Street. These statues represent King Charles II. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Sir John Cutler, a rich merchant whose avarice,
handed down by Pope<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and others, has become immortal.
It seems that in 1675 Sir John&mdash;a near
relation of Dr. Whistler, the president&mdash;expressed
a wish to subscribe towards the rebuilding of the
College of Physicians, which had been destroyed in
the Great Fire, having previously stood at Amen
Corner. When a deputation attended to thank
him, he renewed his promise, and specified the
part of the building for which he intended to pay.
The theatre accordingly bore on its front towards
Warwick Lane the inscription, ‘Theatrum Cutlerianum.’
In the year 1680 statues in honour of
the king and the knight were voted by members
of the college. A certain amount of money must
have been furnished, and some years afterwards
Cutler advanced them more; but after his death
his executors, in 1699, claimed the whole with
interest, the money pretended to be given, and
that actually given, being alike set down as a loan
in Cutler’s books. The demand was compromised
for £2,000. The statue remained, but the college
wisely obliterated the inscription which, in the
warmth of its gratitude, it had placed beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
figure: ‘Omnis Cutleri cedat labor amphitheatro.’
Pennant<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> is responsible for the above account, perhaps
overcoloured, which he gave on the authority of
Dr. Richard Warren. Strype speaks of Sir John as a
great benefactor to the college; he had no doubt given
largely to the Grocers’ Company, of which he was
warden, and a portrait of him is in their possession.</p>

<p>I will now ask my readers to come with me to
the Museum, which well repays a visit. I understand
that the nucleus of it was formed in 1829,
when various antiquities, discovered in digging the
foundations of the then new Post Office in St.
Martin’s-le-Grand, the new London Bridge, and
in the destruction of the Guildhall Chapel, were
brought together; but it has only of late years
become important. I have already described the
sculptured signs which here find a home; let me
now briefly call attention to other objects which
seem to me especially interesting. There is an
article on them in the <i>City Press</i> for September 5,
1891, to which I am indebted for several useful
hints. The accumulation of earth and débris in
the City is so great, that the present town is raised
many feet above Roman London. Now that
excavations for new buildings are carried down
much deeper than formerly, valuable objects are
not unfrequently brought to light. The Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
antiquities in the Museum are many and important;
of these perhaps the most striking is a large
piece of tessellated pavement from Bucklersbury,
in almost perfect condition. It was found no less
than 19 feet below the level of the roadway, on
which account it is thought to be an early relic of
the Roman occupation. One of the good deeds
of the much-abused Metropolitan Board of Works
was the gift of this piece of pavement to the
Corporation. In the course of excavations in the
City no less than three bastions of the original
wall have been discovered. The foundations of
these were formed by masses of statuary, inscriptions,
and other débris of earlier Roman buildings.
A fine specimen is the statue of a Roman soldier,
found at the bastion in Camomile Street a few
years since. Then there is a sculptured lion
fiercely attacking another animal, and many similar
remains of equal or greater interest; to describe
them all in the briefest way would fill a chapter.
About one other relic of the Roman occupation
I shall say a few words, because it appears
to be an almost unique instance of a joke, written
by a Roman with his own hand. This is a tile
found in the Roman wall during the excavations
for Cutler’s Hall in Warwick Square. On it are
the following words, evidently incised when it was
still soft: ‘Austalis, Dibusu vagatur sib cotidem,’
which was thus translated by the late Mr. Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Roach Smith: ‘Austalis wanders off (from his
work) by himself to the Gods every day.’ The
sentence is thought to apply to a workman who
was in the habit of absenting himself at odd
intervals, for purposes of prayer maybe&mdash;or more
likely of refreshment, and to have been written by
a fellow workman.</p>

<p>Of later objects, the various specimens of
mediæval skates are worth mentioning. Each
one is fashioned out of the tibia of a horse. They
have been found from time to time in the neighbourhood
of Moorfields, and well exemplify the
description written by Fitzstephen in the twelfth
century, wherein he tells us that ‘when the fen or
moor which watereth the walls of the City on the
north side, is frozen, many young men play upon
the ice&mdash;some tie bones to their feet, and shoving
themselves by a little picked staff, do slide as
quickly as a bird flieth through the air, or an
arrow out of a crossbow.’ Interesting also are
the flat caps of burgesses, considered to be of the
time of Henry VII., which were found in Finsbury,
May, 1887, and exhibited to the members of the
British Archæological Association by Mr. J. W.
Bailey. They resemble the flatter kind of Scotch
caps, or the Basque caps, and have a peculiar little
flap behind. Gold coins were discovered in the
double rims of these caps, kept there for safety,
no doubt; one of them an angel, of the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Richard II. Then there is a fine collection of
Elizabethan graybeard jugs or bellarmines, the
grotesque heads on them being caricatured from
the cardinal of that name, who so strongly opposed
the reformed religion. Among larger objects, a
splendid fireplace from the old mansion in Lime
Street which belonged to the Fishmongers’ Company,
and on which Messrs. G. H. Birch and R.
Phené Spiers drew up such a valuable monograph
at the time of its destruction. An old stone
conduit from South Molton Street is worth a
glance. It has on it the City arms and the date
1627, and was found six feet below the pavement.
There is interest of a kind, too, in the inscription
from Pudding Lane, affixed in 1681 by overzealous
Protestants to the house of Farryner, the
King’s baker, where the Great Fire of London
first began. This inscription was taken down in
the reign of James II., replaced in that of William
III., and finally removed about the middle of last
century. It was found in the cellar and brought
here when the house (latterly numbered 25) was
pulled down in 1876.</p>

<p>A few signs not sculptured are, I think, worth
alluding to. One of the quaintest is composed of
blue and yellow Dutch tiles, and was doubtless
once fixed near the entrance of a coffee-house, but
unfortunately no record of it has been preserved.
It is about twenty inches high, and represents a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
boy with long hair, in seventeenth-century costume,
somewhat like that of the modern Bluecoat boys.
He is standing, and pouring out coffee; by his
side is a table, with appliances for drinking, and
tobacco pipes, and above, on a scroll, the words
‘<span class="smcap">dish of coffee boy</span>.’ A sign of this kind in
remarkable preservation, and finely executed, is
the Cock and Bottle&mdash;three to four feet high, and
worked in blue and white Dutch tiles with an
ornamental border&mdash;which came from Cannon
Street. The date of this sign is said to be about
1700; the house to which it belonged formerly
stood on the south side, and was pulled down in
1853, at the time of the Cannon Street alterations.
A public-house (Nos. 94 and 96), still called the
Cock and Bottle, occupies the site. A sign of
a Dolphin which belongs to the earlier part of
the eighteenth century was in 1890 presented by
Messrs. Burrup, so long pleasantly connected with
the Surrey Cricket Club. It is painted on copper,
and comes from a shop on the south side of the
old Royal Exchange, where an ancestor of the
Burrup family was first established in 1730. A
unique relic is the little plate of metal, inscribed
as follows:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘Abraham Bartlett, who makes ye boulting mills and
cloathes, dwells at the sign of the boulting mill at Thames
Street, near Queenhith, London, 1678.’</p>

<p class="p1">It is surmounted by a grotesque head, and fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
on a thin piece of wood with a ring for hanging it
up. The boulting-mill was used for sifting meal
by shaking it backwards and forwards, boulting-cloth
being a material of loose texture for the meal
to pass through. Of doubtful origin is a classically
designed figure of a boy in low relief, with foliated
border, and the date 1633; the material of this is
cast iron. Another curious relic is a wooden
statuette of Time, with scythe and hour-glass,
which formerly belonged to the clock in the
church of St. Giles, Cripplegate. The inscription
tells us that it was presented by the churchwardens,
who in my opinion ought never to have
removed it from the church for which it had
been carved, where it was far more appropriately
placed than it can possibly be here; though of
course one is glad that it is preserved.</p>

<p>Last, not least, a very interesting stone bas-relief
of doubtful origin, which purports to represent
Whittington and his cat, was bequeathed
by the Rev. Canon Lysons. The figure in
question is doubtless that of a boy carrying a little
quadruped in his arms. The tablet to which it
belongs seems to have been broken off on the
side to the spectator’s left, and therefore probably
formed part of a larger piece of sculpture. This
relic, which at a first glance seems to resemble a
sculptured house-sign, was exhibited some years
ago at a meeting of the Archæological Institute.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Mr. Lysons stated on that occasion that it was
dug up in Westgate Street, Gloucester. From a
rent-roll of 1460, he had learned that in the said
year Richard ‘Whitynton,’ lord of the manor of
Staunton, possessed a house or houses, called
‘Rotten Row, or Asschowellys-place’; and from
a lease it appeared that the house, in the foundations
of which the stone was found, stands
exactly on the site of Asschowellys (in modern
orthography Ashwell’s) Place. The Richard Whittington
here alluded to was great-nephew of the
renowned Lord Mayor of London, living contemporaneously
with his famous namesake, the
rent-roll above named having been made within
thirty-seven years of Sir Richard’s death. This is
certainly a very singular coincidence, and if it
could be proved that the tablet in question
represented Whittington and his cat, we might
consider that the tradition about him, which has
delighted the childhood of so many thousands,
was really founded on fact. Mr. Lysons was
strongly of that opinion; he stated, however, that
the house in Westgate Street, under which the
tablet was found, besides being on the site of Ashwell’s
Place, is also on the site of a Roman temple&mdash;and
perhaps most impartial observers will be
inclined to think that the costume of the figure, and
the general style of the tablet in question, point
rather to indifferent Roman than to fifteenth-century
work.</p>

<p class="drop-cap04">IN connection with sculptured signs, and again
when alluding to the arms of the Fowler
family, and to Canonbury, I have had occasion to
describe houses in Islington. I shall now take up
the thread of my discourse, from the White Lion
on the west side of the High Street, and ask the
kind reader to explore with me the sites of some
of the old places of entertainment nearer London.
A short distance further south is the Angel, rebuilt
in 1819. This was one of the picturesque old
galleried inns which have now become almost
extinct. Close at hand, on the opposite side of
the way, is the old Red Lion tavern, very much
rejuvenated; it puts forward a bold claim to date
from the year 1415. On the gables are shields,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
apparently modern, with lions in relief. Seventy or
eighty years ago this house stood almost alone on
the high-road. Here Tom Paine was said to have
written his ‘Rights of Man,’ and the tradition is
that Goldsmith, Thomson, nay even the great
Dr. Johnson, visited it. In the middle distance of
Hogarth’s picture of ‘Evening,’ there is a house,
supposed to be the old Red Lion, which shows
how rural were its then surroundings. The scene
is laid in front of the Myddleton’s Head&mdash;also
at that time apparently a country wayside inn,
which, says Pinks, had been built in 1614. A
portrait of the worthy founder of the New River
Company projects by way of sign from the gable.
This house stood on the south side of Sadler’s
Wells Theatre, from which it was separated by
the New River. Malcolm has recorded that in
1803 it was still picturesque. He says: ‘A few
paces northwards (from Islington Spa) conduct the
passenger under a portrait of Sir Hugh Myddleton
(tolerably well painted), who faces his river
adorned with tall poplars, graceful willows, sloping
banks, and flowers.’ How changed is now the
scene! The trees have long since perished as
utterly as the anglers,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> ‘the noble swans’ and
water-fowl, of an earlier time; and Sir Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
would no longer face his once pleasant stream,
which in its old age has disappeared from sight,
and taken refuge under ground. In 1831 the
Sir Hugh Myddleton tavern replaced the former
house of entertainment. This, in its turn, has
now ceased to exist, having been pulled down, with
other houses in Myddleton Place, to make room for
the new thoroughfare<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> from the Angel, Islington,
to Holborn Town Hall, opened July 9, 1892,
under the name of Rosebery Avenue.</p>

<p>One of the leading characteristics of London
citizens of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
was their taste for frequenting public gardens
and houses of amusement in the suburbs. Many
of these were originally health-resorts&mdash;‘spas’ or
‘wells,’ they were called, from the springs of
mineral water which had formed the chief attraction.
In such places the northern suburbs abounded, and
the parish of Clerkenwell<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> might be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
their headquarters. At a time when travelling
was toilsome and costly, sometimes even dangerous,
it was useful to have a little Buxton or Harrogate
close at hand. To supply the demand, some enterprising
person discovered a spring with rare healing
powers; some doctor wrote it up, and the place
became, for a time at least, fashionable. Such a
spa in St. George’s Fields I have already described.
Let me say a few words about others equally interesting,
in the neighbourhood in which we now
find ourselves.</p>

<p>Not far from the site of the Myddleton’s Head,
on the north side of the New River, no longer
visible, and close to the New River Head, stands
Sadler’s Wells Theatre, built on the site of one of
these places of health-resort. It seems that some
time before 1683, a certain Mr. Sadler, said to have
been a surveyor of highways, had put up a wooden
building hereabouts, which was known as Sadler’s
Music-house. In that year his servants, when
digging in the garden for gravel, were reported
to have discovered a mineral spring, and in 1684
a pamphlet was published by a doctor named
Thomas Guidot, puffing the curative powers of
the water. He speaks of five or six hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
patients being there every morning, and assures
us that the spring had merely been rediscovered:
‘The priests belonging to the Priory of Clarkenwell,
using to attend there, making the people
believe that the virtues of the waters proceeded
from the efficacy of their prayers.’ ‘These superstitions,’
he adds, ‘were the occasion of its being
arched over and concealed at the time of the
Reformation.’</p>

<p>In spite of this fine puff, the waters, apparently,
soon ceased to attract, though they continued to
be sold in Sadler’s name for some time, as shown by
an advertisement of June, 1697.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In 1699 the
building was advertised as Miles’s Musick-house.
The place had then become known as a resort for
very disorderly characters. Miles was succeeded
by Francis Forcer, whose father, a musician, seems
to have lived on the spot.</p>

<p>The son, said to have been an Oxford man, introduced
the diversions of tumbling, and rope-dancing
with the pranks of Harlequin and Scaramouch.
He died in 1743, and in the following year the
establishment was being carried on by one John
Warren, when it was presented by a Middlesex
Grand Jury as a place of ‘great extravagance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
luxury, idleness, and ill-fame.’ Soon afterwards
it got into the hands of Mr. Rosoman,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> who
in 1765 pulled down Sadler’s wooden erection,
and built a regular theatre on the site.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last century Sadler’s Wells
was still some distance from London, and the roads
were by no means safe. George Daniel, in his
‘Merrie England,’ says: ‘It is curious to read at
the bottom of the old bills and advertisements
the following alarming announcements, “A horse
patrol will be sent in the New Road that night,
for the protection of the nobility and gentry who
go from the squares and that end of the town;
the road also towards the city will be properly
guarded.” Again, “June, 1783.&mdash;Patroles of
horse and foot are stationed from Sadler’s Wells
gate along the New Road to Tottenham Court
Turnpike; likewise from the City Road to Moorfields;
also to St. John Street, and across the Spa
fields to Rosoman Row, from the hours of eight to
eleven.”’ On Easter Monday, April 2, 1804, a
new sort of entertainment called ‘Naumachia’
was produced at Sadler’s Wells. An immense
tank had been constructed under the stage and
beyond it, which could be filled by water from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
New River, and emptied at pleasure. On this
aquatic stage, the boards being removed, was given
a mimic representation of the Siege of Gibraltar,
in which real vessels of considerable size bombarded
the fortress, but were subdued by the
garrison and to all appearance burnt.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> After
a time the success of the novelty was prodigious,
and many pieces of the same kind were afterwards
produced. This theatre was distinguished a
generation ago as the home of Shakespearean
drama, under the management of that sterling
actor Samuel Phelps. It was rebuilt in 1879.
The actual site of the old well has long been lost;
Malcolm asserted that it had been discovered
some time before he wrote ‘in the space between
the New River and the stage-door’ of the theatre,
and that it was said to have been encircled with
stone, with a descent of several steps. Cromwell,
however, writing a few years later, tells us that
‘persons who have an intimate acquaintance with
the theatre for the last half-century have no
recollection of the discovery; and as it is known
that springs yet exist under the orchestra and
stage, it seems probable that the ancient healing
fountain might be traced to that situation.’</p>

<p>For a few years, during the first half of the
seventeenth century, there was a rival to Sadler’s
Wells in a popular place of amusement called ‘The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
New Wells near the London Spa.’ There were
gardens here, and a theatre, in which took place
what we should now call variety entertainments.
Mrs. Charlotte Charke&mdash;the eccentric daughter of
Colley Cibber, was one of the performers. Ceasing
to attract, it was closed in 1747, the theatre being
afterwards used as a chapel under the auspices of
John Wesley, and, according to Pinks, the houses
Nos. 5 to 8, Rosoman Street now occupy the
site.</p>

<p>Lysons, Halliwell Phillipps, and others, have
confused the mineral spring discovered by Sadler
with a mineral spring of greater celebrity called
the New Tunbridge Wells; but, though near
each other, they were quite distinct. In 1699
a narrative poem was published under the title
of ‘A Walk to Islington, with a Description
of New Tunbridge Wells and Sadler’s Musick
House,’ in which the fame of the wells is ascribed
to its medicinal water, and that of the music-house
to such good cheer as cheesecakes, custards, bottled
ale and cider, and the diversions of singing and
dancing. An article in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>
for December, 1813, puts the matter beyond
a doubt; and their relative positions are clearly
marked in Horwood’s map of 1799. New Tunbridge
Wells, or the Islington Spa (really, of course,
in the parish of Clerkenwell), was a spring of
chalybeate water in a garden, the entrance to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
until 1810 was opposite the New River Head on
the south side; No. 6, Eliza Place marked the
site. This street, a continuation west of Myddleton
Place, has, like it, been absorbed by Rosebery
Avenue. The spa was open to the public before
1685, as is proved by a curious advertisement in
the <i>London Gazette</i> of September 24 in that year:
‘Whereas Mr. John Langley, of London, Merchant,
who bought the Rhinoceros and Islington Wells,
has been represented by divers of his malicious
adversaries to be a person of no estate or reputation,
nor able to discharge his debts; which evil
practices have been on purpose to ruin and destroy
his reputation,’ etc. The character of the
company soon after this may be judged from
a burlesque poem, published in 1691; it contains
the lines which head this chapter. In 1700
there was ‘music for dancing all day long,
every Monday and Thursday during the summer
season. No mask to be admitted.’ A few years
later the spa became fashionable, being patronized
by ladies of such position as Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu. It was at its zenith in 1733, when the
Princesses Amelia and Caroline, daughters of
George II., came daily in the summer and drank
the waters. At this time, as we learn from the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, ‘Such was the concourse
of nobility and others that the proprietor took
above £30 in a morning. On the birthday of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Princesses, as they passed through the Spa Field
(which was generally filled with carriages), they
were saluted with a discharge of 21 guns, a compliment
which was always paid them on their arrival;
and in the evening there was a great bonfire, and
the guns were discharged several times.’ Islington
Spa continued with, on the whole, declining
fortune throughout the rest of the eighteenth
century. Soon afterwards it was found necessary
to curtail the garden, and a great part of the old
coffee-room was pulled down. About the year
1810, the old entrance being closed, a new one
was made in Lloyd’s Row; and finally, in 1840,
what remained of the garden was altogether done
away with, and two rows of houses, called Spa
Cottages, were built on the site. Even now there
is a house at the corner of Lloyd’s Row and Spa
Cottages, the residence of the last proprietor, which
recalls the vanished glory of other days by the
inscription in capital letters, ‘<span class="smcap">islington spa, or
new tunbridge wells</span>.’ At the back, in the
cellar of No. 6, Spa Cottages, I have seen grotto-work
with stone pilasters; on each side are steps
descending. Here, I believe, was the original
chalybeate spring; for many years it has ceased to
flow.</p>

<p>Horwood’s map of 1799 shows some of these
suburban spas and places of amusement very distinctly.
Islington Spa is marked just south of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
New River Head, and over a hundred yards south-west
of Sadler’s Wells. The garden is of considerable
size, running east, apparently to St. John
Street Road. A short distance to the west, and
also near the New River Head, is Merlin’s Cave&mdash;a
rural tavern and holiday-resort of Londoners&mdash;named,
it is said, after an artificial cave, dug out
in 1835 in the royal gardens at Richmond, by
order of Queen Caroline, and of which there was
here, perhaps, a humble imitation.</p>

<p>Again, some distance to the south of the New
River Head, at the corner of Rosoman Street and
Exmouth Street, one sees the words ‘London
Spa,’ on a public-house with that sign erected in
1835 to replace a former building. This is on
or near the site of another mineral spring once, as
we have seen, sufficiently famous to be named in
a description of the New Wells,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> a neighbouring
establishment. In ‘Poor Robin’s Almanack’ for
1733, occurs the following doggerel, which refers
to the month of July:</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Now sweethearts with their sweethearts go<br />
To Islington or London Spaw;<br />
Some go but just to drink the water,<br />
Some for the ale which they like better.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">In point of fact, the spa ale sold here seems before
the middle of the century to have become famous,
when the mineral water was no longer heard of.
Spa Fields, which adjoined, were an open waste,
a Sunday resort of Londoners of the lower class
addicted to rough sports. I have already referred
to these fields at page 69, when speaking of the
Ducking-pond public-house and its successors,
the Pantheon, and Spa Fields Chapel, the first of
‘the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion.’ She
died in the house adjoining it on June 17, 1791.</p>

<p>At the end of last century one might have had
an almost rural walk from the London Spa west
to Bagnigge Wells, a more famous place of entertainment.
The way would have been along
Exmouth Street, then built on the south side only,
and called Braynes Row; a relic of its early days
remains in the form of a tablet between Nos. 32
and 34, which has inscribed on it ‘Braynes Buildings
1765.’ At the end of this street was a turnpike,
and at right angles to it was the Bagnigge
Wells Road, the lower portion of which had the
suggestive name of Coppice Row. North-west
from the turnpike, it ran between fields as far as
a little group of houses called Brook Place, and
then a few more steps would have taken one to
Bagnigge Wells,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> within the borders of St. Pancras.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
There was a tradition, unsupported, I believe, by
any evidence, that Nell Gwynne had here a place
of summer abode, ‘pleasantly situated amid the
Fields, and on the banks of the Fleet,’ then a
clear stream flowing rapidly and somewhat subject
to floods. This was Bagnigge House, a gabled
building, some trace of which still remained as
late as the year 1844. Inside, it had originally
some curious decorative features; over a chimney-piece
in one of the rooms were the Royal arms and
other heraldic bearings, and between them ‘the
bust of a woman in Roman dress, let deep into a
circular cavity of the wall, bordered with festoons
of delf earth in the natural colours and glazed.’
These were afterwards removed from this position,
and set up in a long room built for assemblies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
balls, which, formed the eastern boundary of the
garden. An aquatint print of the interior of
this room was published by J. R. Smith in 1772,
after a painting by Saunders. The place seems
to have been opened for purposes of amusement
early in the eighteenth century; for in Beckham’s<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
curious work, the ‘Musical Entertainer’
(<i>circa</i> 1738), is an engraving of Tom Hippersly
there, mounted in the ‘singing rostrum,’ regaling
the company with a song. The inevitable healing
springs, which always, no doubt, made their
appearance when wanted, were, it would seem, a
comparatively late discovery, first introduced to the
public by Dr. John Bevis, who in 1760 wrote ‘An
Experimental Enquiry concerning the Contents,
Quality and Medicinal Value of two Mineral Waters
lately discovered at Bagnigge Wells near London.’
One was supposed to be purging, and the other
chalybeate; he gives an elaborate account of each.
About the year 1775 the place<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
‘The Sunday Ramble’ as ‘by no means barren of
amusement, and visited in the morning by hundreds
of persons to drink the water, and on summer
afternoons by numerous tea-drinking parties.’
The writer tells of ‘beautiful walks ornamented
with a great variety of curious shrubs and flowers
all in the utmost perfection,’ and ‘a small round
fish-pond, in the centre of which is a curious
fountain representing Cupid bestriding a swan,
which spouts the water to a great height.’ The
Fleet,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> or, as it was sometimes there called, the
Bagnigge River, now a sewer, but at that time still
comparatively undefiled, flowed through part of
the garden; it was crossed by a bridge, and the
banks were rich with vegetation, insomuch that, as
Archer tells us, Luke Clennell, the artist, often
came here and made foreground studies for his
pictures. But tastes change: the mineral waters
ceased to attract; people of fashion came no more.
As early as 1779 Bagnigge Wells is described as a
place</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘Where ‘prenticed youth enjoy the Sunday feast,<br />
And City matrons boast their Sabbath rest,<br />
Where unfledged Templars first as fops parade,<br />
And new-made ensigns sport their first cockade.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">Later it became a mere cockney tea-garden, and
gradually declined, till in Lewis’s ‘History of
Islington,’ 1842, it is described as almost a ruin.
Shortly afterwards it was closed and dismantled,
and now all trace of it has disappeared, save the
name, which has been appropriated by a modern
tavern at the corner of King’s Cross Road (formerly
Bagnigge Wells Road) and Pakenham Street, and
a curious stone tablet surmounted by a grotesque
head, of which I here give an illustration.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-195.jpg" width="350" height="537" id="i195"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>This is now to be seen built into the wall between two
modern houses&mdash;Nos. 61 and 63, King’s Cross
Road&mdash;probably near the north-western limit of
the garden. It is mentioned by Dr. Bevis in 1760
as having been ‘over an old Gothic portal taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
down about three years ago, and now replaced
over the door from the high-road to the house.’
At that time, I believe, the grotesque head was
added. About thirty years ago, as may be learned
from a letter in the <i>Builder</i>, January, 1863, the
doorway was pulled down and the stone fixed
where one may still see it, in front of the houses
built on the site. I was glad to find this stone still
in existence; it is worth rescuing from oblivion.
The inscription runs as follows: ‘This is Bagnigge
House neare the Pinder a Wakefielde 1680.’</p>

<p>The latter place, thus referred to, was an old
country tavern in the Gray’s Inn Road. Mr.
Wheatley says it was on the west side, and that
the small houses between Harrison Street and
Cromer Street, till recently called Pindar Place,
occupied the site; and, confirming his statement, it
is shown in Strype’s map on the west side of ‘the
road to Hamstead.’ The modern public-house
with this sign is on the east side. Tom Brown,
in his ‘Comical View of London and Westminster,’
published in 1705, gives us a pleasant glimpse of
the then surroundings&mdash;of a stile near Lamb’s
Conduit, and ‘a milkmaid crossing the fields to
Pinder of Wakefield.’ There is mention of it
immediately after the Great Fire, by Aubrey.
When the inscription was first put up, Bagnigge
House and the Pinder of Wakefield were probably
next-door neighbours, though their sites are now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
separated by a dreary wilderness of bricks and
mortar. Palmer, in his ‘History of St. Pancras,’
records that in 1724 the Pinder of Wakefield was
destroyed in a hurricane, the landlord’s two
daughters being buried in the ruins. The word
Pinder, equivalent to pinner or penner, was applied
to the keeper of the public pen or pound for the
confinement of stray cattle. George a-Green, or
the Pinder of the town of Wakefield, is the
subject of a prose romance supposed to be as old
as the time of Queen Elizabeth. He (so runs the
legend), with his back to a thorn and his foot to
a stone, thrashed no less a foe than Robin Hood.</p>

<p>Before quitting this branch of my subject, I will
say a few words about a former health-resort within
a stone’s throw of the old Pinder of Wakefield.
On the east side of Gray’s Inn Road, near the upper
end, by the King’s Cross Station on the Metropolitan
Railway, is a shabby-looking passage called
St. Chad’s Row, which, turning to the north, runs
into King’s Cross Road, and here is the site of the
well named after St. Chad or St. Ceadda, who
founded the bishopric of Lichfield, and died in
672. In Laurie and Whittle’s map of 1800, the
extension of Gray’s Inn Road northwards is called
St. Chad’s Road. The well, however, as far as I
can ascertain, was not particularly ancient&mdash;or, if
so, the early records are lost. Hone describes it
in his ‘Everyday Book’ in the following prophetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
words: ‘St. Chad’s Well is near Battle Bridge.
The miraculous water is aperient, and was some
years ago quaffed by the bilious and other
invalids, who flocked thither in crowds.... A
few years and it will be with its waters as with the
water of St. Pancras’ Well, which is enclosed in
the garden of a private house near old St. Pancras
Churchyard.’</p>

<p>The garden attached to St. Chad’s Well seems
in the last century to have been famous for its
tulips; at least, if one may believe an advertisement
in my possession, which has the date 1779.
It speaks of ‘The largest and richest collection
of early Dutch tulips ever yet seen in Great
Britain, now in bloom, with many fine double
hyacinths of various colours raised by Van
Hawsen, to be had of Richard Morris at St.
Chad’s Wells, Battle Bridge, near London; the
lowest prices marked in the catalogue, which may
be had as above, and the flowers seen gratis. No
person admitted with a dog. Seedsmen and
gardeners will be furnished wholesale with Duke
Vantol, Claremond, and many other sorts of early
tulips at the Dutch prices, and with the usual
discount: the grand present Auricula at 1s. per
pot: Gold and Silver Fish cheap.’ Mr. Pinks
gives the particulars of the sale by auction of St.
Chad’s Well on September 14, 1837. It seems
that there was then a brick house facing Gray’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Inn Lane, having a pump-room and a large
garden at the back. The water appears to have
been still sold three years afterwards, when a
pamphlet was issued setting forth ‘the characteristic
virtues of the Saint Chad’s Wells aperient
and alterative springs.’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">TWO OLD CITY MANSIONS.</p>

<p class="pbq">‘The crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose
traffickers are the honourable of the earth.’</p>

<p class="pr12 reduct"><i>Isaiah</i> xxiii. 8.</p>

<p class="drop-cap06">BEFORE the summer of 1892 a large and
interesting old mansion was destroyed in
the City. This, known as Nos. 8 and 9, Great
St. Helen’s, Bishopsgate Street, was situated on the
south side of the churchyard. It was of brick,
having engaged pilasters, which were furnished
with stone bases and capitals; they also had bands,
on two of which, composed, however, of cement,
appeared in relief the initials <span class="smcap"><sub>a</sub><sup>l</sup><sub>i</sub></span> and the date
1646. The projecting sills or cornices, and the
deep keystones of the first-floor windows, gave a
striking character to the house. It was also
memorable as an early specimen of brickwork in
London, and as dating from a period before the
formal conclusion of the Civil War, when building
operations were almost at a standstill. No. 9 had,
in a room on the first-floor, a wooden seventeenth-century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
mantelpiece,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> behind which, on its removal,
were found traces of an older mantelpiece of marble,
and evidence of the former existence of a large
open fireplace.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">NOS. 8 AND 9, GREAT ST. HELEN’S.</p>
</div></div>

<p>There was a beautiful staircase,
quite Elizabethan in style; a blocked-up window
with wooden transoms for casements was also
discovered; so it seems likely that some years
after the building of the house considerable alterations
took place. The façade has often been
attributed to Inigo Jones,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> but it had not his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
classic symmetry, and looked like the work of a
less-instructed native genius. Besides, Inigo Jones,
a Royalist and Roman Catholic, was taken prisoner
in October, 1645, at the storming of Basing
House, having been there during the siege, which
had lasted since August, 1643. He was apparently
not free to return to his profession until
July 2, 1646, when, after payment of a heavy fine,
his estate, which had been sequestrated, was restored
to him, and he received pardon by an ordinance of
the House of Commons, to which the Lords gave
their assent. It is difficult to believe that, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
he was passing through such a crisis, or in the
few months succeeding it, he should have been
superintending a work in the Puritan City. At
the time of his release the great architect was
seventy-four years of age, and, as far as we know,
he hardly practised his profession afterwards.
Aubrey tells us that in 1648, the south side of
Wilton House having been destroyed, it was
restored by his advice, ‘but he being then very
old could not be there in person, but left it to
Mr. Webb,’ his pupil and executor.</p>

<p>The division of Nos. 8 and 9, Great St. Helen’s
into two took place in the course of last century,
probably about 1750, to judge from the style of
the fanlights and projecting hoods to the front-doors,
and from the staircase of No. 8, the upper
part of which, however, was much more archaic,
and may have served as part of the back-staircase
to the original house. At the time of these later
alterations a new brick front was put to the top
story, the windows being protected by high iron
railings, which showed that these upper rooms
were used as nurseries. Before this there was,
I should imagine, a high-pitched roof, perhaps
hipped, with dormer windows. There must also
have been an appropriate cornice and frieze, which
would have balanced the heavy projecting window-sills
below. That the house always had a fourth
story is proved by the fact that both the old staircases
extended to the top. The accompanying
illustration of part of the front is from a beautiful
measured drawing by Mr. H. O. Tarbolton, who
studied the house very carefully just before its
demolition.</p>

<p>In Allen’s ‘History of London,’ vol. iii., p. 157,
I find a statement that this brick mansion (identified
by mention of its initials and date) was ‘formerly
the residence of Sir J. Lawrence, Lord Mayor
in 1665.’ This appears to be the origin of the
idea that the house was built for him, and that he
kept his mayoralty there, which has of late been
usually accepted as a fact. There is no doubt that
Nos. 8 and 9, Great St. Helen’s was his property
in 1665, but he was living in a house of totally
different appearance&mdash;an illustration of which, by
T. Prattent, published in 1796, forms the frontispiece
to vol. xxix. of the <i>European Magazine</i>. As
there shown, it had elaborate plaster decorations
in front, with the City arms and the arms of
Lawrence, and last, though not least, the inscription
<span class="smcap">s</span><sup>r</sup> <span class="smcap">jl&mdash;k &amp; a.</span> 1662. Sir John Lawrence’s residence
is marked by name in the map of Bishopsgate
Street Ward accompanying Strype’s Stow,
where a slight sketch of it is also given; the
present Jewish synagogue in Great St. Helen’s is
a little bit west of the site.</p>

<p>Having looked up the history of the Lawrence
family, and its connection with this parish, I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
I can show that the initials on the pilaster of
Nos. 8 and 9, Great St. Helen’s were not those
of Sir John Lawrence and his wife Abigail, but
of his uncle Adam and his uncle’s wife. The
Lawrences, like many other eminent mercantile
families, were originally Dutch or Flemish. The
name was spelt in various ways, as Laurens, Laureijns,
Laurents, etc., until, when its possessors
became thoroughly anglicized, it took the English
form. Le Neve, the herald, says that a Marcus
Lawrence, from Flanders, who had married Gertrude
Huesen, came and settled in London. He
had, among other children, a son Abraham and a
son Adam. The latter was baptized at the Dutch
Church, Austin Friars, September 8, 1584;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and
one may fairly assume that it was he who there
married, May 28, 1610, Judith Van den Brugghe,
of Norwich, where there was then a strong settlement
of people from the Low Countries. He was
appointed deacon of the Dutch Church in 1628,
and became an elder in 1632. Eleven years later
he had taken up his residence in Great St. Helen’s,
as we learn from an entry in the parish register,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
which suggests the forlorn condition of the homeless
poor in those days. On the 23rd of April,
1643, ‘a female infant, found dead at the dore
of Mr. Adam Lawrence, merchant, was buried in
the churchyard’ there. What house he was then
living in I am not able to determine; but in
the year 1646 the house just now destroyed was
doubtless either built or altered for his own residence,
and on it was placed an inscription,
according to the custom of the country whence
he sprang.</p>

<p>I have previously pointed out that in inscriptions
of this kind the initial of the husband’s Christian
name is almost invariably on the left, the wife’s on
the right, and that of the surname above. The
letters in question would therefore have stood for
‘Adam and Judith Lawrence.’ In 1650 came the
inevitable ending to their long married life.
On the 9th of April it is recorded that Judith
‘Laurents’<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> was buried in the church of Great
St. Helen’s. Adam died in October, 1657. His
will describes him as a merchant, and he seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
have been a very prosperous one. He desires to
be buried near his wife, in Great St. Helen’s, and
leaves £100 to the poor of the Dutch congregation
in Austin Friars, and £100 towards the maintenance
of the ministry there; also similar legacies
for the parish of Great St. Helen’s, and £100 to
the poor children of Christ’s Hospital. Amongst
numerous nephews, he singles out for special favour
John, who seems to have been a son of his brother
Abraham. To him he leaves several houses and
gardens in the parish, amongst others his ‘now
dwelling-house, with the yards, garden edifices,
appurtenances, and hereditaments whatsoever thereunto
belonging.’ This, no doubt, was Nos. 8 and
9, Great St. Helen’s, unless after his wife’s death he
had shifted into another residence. Adam also left
to his nephew John his share in the ‘sister’s thread
trade,’ whatever that may mean, which he had in
partnership with Abraham Cullen,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> the elder, and
Philip Van Cassole; and £1,500 to Abigail, his
nephew’s wife, who died in 1681, and whose
monument still exists in Great St. Helen’s
Church, where it is recorded that she was ‘the
tender mother of ten children. The nine first,
being all daughters, she suckled at her own breasts;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
they all lived to be of age. Her last, a son, died
an infant. Shee lived a married wife 39 years,
23 whereof she was an exemplary matron of this
Cittie,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> dying in the 59th year of her age.’ This
lady was eldest daughter of Abraham Cullen, who
appears to have been nearly related to the Lawrence
family. One paragraph of Adam’s will is
worth quoting, because it seems to indicate that
pretentious public funerals were then not uncommon
in the City, and that he, at any rate, was free
from a taste for vulgar display. He says: ‘Lastly,
my desire is that my funerall be decently performed
without anie pompe or ceremonie of mourners, and
that my corps be carried from my own dwelling
house, not troubling any publique hall.’</p>

<p>John Lawrence, the nephew, seems to have
been a pattern City merchant. He had begun
life as a Bluecoat boy, hence, perhaps, his uncle’s
legacy. In 1658 he served the office of Sheriff.
On June 16, 1660, he was knighted by Charles II.,
when that monarch, accompanied by his brothers,
the Dukes of York and Gloucester, and some
of the nobility, was entertained at supper by
the Lord Mayor, Sir Thomas Alleyne. In 1662
Sir John Lawrence appears to have built a new
house for himself, the one before alluded to, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
was drawn by Prattent, not unlikely on a ‘garden
plot’ mentioned in his uncle’s will. In 1664 he
was elected Lord Mayor, and Evelyn speaks of a
‘most magnificent triumph by water and land’ on
that occasion. Evelyn also attended the Lord
Mayor’s banquet, and tells us that it was said to
have cost £1,000. He dined at the upper table
with the Lord Chancellor, the Dukes of Albermarle,
Ormonde and Buckingham, the French
Ambassador and other great personages. The
Lord Mayor twice came up to them, ‘first drinking
in the golden goblet his Majesty’s health, then
the French King’s as a compliment to the
Ambassador’; they ‘returned my Lord Mayor’s
health, the trumpets and drums sounding. The
cheer was not to be imagined for the plenty and
rarity, with an infinite number of persons at the
tables in that ample hall.’ Sir John Lawrence
showed both courage and liberality whilst the
Great Plague was raging in the following year.
He stuck to his post, ‘enforced the wisest regulations
then known,’ and, when multitudes of servants
were dismissed through fear of contagion, he is
said to have ‘supported them all, as well as the
needy who were sick; at first by expending his
own fortune, till subscriptions could be solicited
and received from all parts of the nation.’ Dr.
Erasmus Darwin, in his ‘Loves of the Plants,’
canto ii., devotes a few lines to ‘London’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
generous Mayor.’ Five deaths only are recorded
in Great St. Helen’s during the year 1665, which
suggests that those connected with the Church
showed less courage than the chief parishioner, and
that the register was neglected.</p>

<p>In 1684 the house of late numbered 8 and 9,
Great St. Helen’s was in the occupation of one
William Moses. That year Sir John Lawrence,
who so far had not handed over his uncle’s legacy
for the poor of the parish, agreed to discharge his
obligation by payment of £250, and to give £100
in addition for leave to make a family vault in the
church. In 1690 Sir John was living in Putney,
as appears from the churchwardens’ accounts.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
He died January, 1691-2, and was buried on the
29th of that month, in the family vault which
had been constructed for him under the church
of Great St. Helen’s, but no monument to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
memory exists. The Rev. J. E. Cox, D.D., in his
‘Annals of St. Helen’s’ tells us that at the church
restoration of 1865-8 ‘a quaint piece of carved
work, which had been set up to sustain the Lord
Mayor’s sword and mace, was removed to the
pillar dividing the choir from the Chapel of the
Holy Ghost.’ The following is a description of it
taken almost verbatim from Allen: ‘It consists of
two twisted Corinthian columns, supporting an
entablature highly enriched, and an attic panel.
The shafts of the columns are set off with a
wreath of foliage running round them. On the
frieze are the arms of Sir John Lawrence, in the
attic are the City arms, and the whole structure is
crowned with the arms of Charles II., supported
by two gilt angels, and surmounted with the royal
crown.’ I hope that this interesting memento of
a great City worthy, though not ‘Gothic’ in
style, will be carefully preserved during the far
more wholesale restoration which is now in progress.</p>

<p>Sir John Lawrence’s arms were: argent, a cross
raguly gules, a canton ermine.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Peter le Neve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
says that they were granted to him September 18,
1664, and to his brothers James and Abraham,
sons of Abraham Lawrence deceased; but it must
have been earlier, as they appear on his house
associated with the date 1662. Faulkner, in his
‘History of Chelsea,’ no doubt deceived by
the fact that their arms were identical, assumes
that Sir John Lawrence belonged to the ancient
English family of the same name, whose memory
is perpetuated by various monuments at the end
of the north aisle of Chelsea old church. Both
he and Dr. Cox<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> go so far as to say that Sir
John was buried there; but his namesake, ‘Sir
John Lawrence, Knight and Baronet,’ to whose
memory a tablet was placed against the east
wall of Chelsea Church, belonged to Iver, in
the county of Bucks, and died in 1638, aged fifty
years, as appears by the inscription. For several
generations the descendants of the famous Lord
Mayor continued to own the house which became
Nos. 8 and 9, Great St. Helen’s. It afterwards
passed into the hands of the Guise family,
from whom it was inherited by an ancestor of the
last possessor, Mr. John Cosens Stevens. Peace be
to its memory!</p>

<p>The passage from Great St. Helen’s into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Bishopsgate Street passes under old gabled buildings
which date from before the time of the Great
Fire. On the left is the northern front of Crosby
Hall, part of a Gothic mansion unrivalled in its
day, though little of the original structure remains.
This side was almost entirely rebuilt more than
fifty years ago. The oriel window, weathered by
London atmosphere, has a very picturesque effect;
it is surmounted by the arms of Sir John Crosby,
the eminent citizen who built and first possessed
the mansion, and who lies buried in the adjoining
church, where there is a rich altar-tomb to his
memory, with the recumbent figures of him and
his first wife, Anneys. On this tomb also are the
Crosby arms, namely: sable, a chevron ermine
between three rams trippant argent, armed and
hoofed or. Sir John, a keen supporter of the
House of York, was knighted by Edward IV. in
the year 1471; he served as Sheriff of London in
1470, and held the important post of Mayor of
the Staple of Calais.</p>

<p>Opposite to Crosby Hall, on the northern side
of Great St. Helen’s Passage, there stood till
September, 1892, a structure which, though unpretentious,
had an air of quaintness, with its iron
railings in front and broad white window-frames.
The inscription on a tablet above the door of
this building ran as follows: ‘These alms-houses
were founded by Sir Andrew Judd, Kt., Citizen &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Skinner and Lord Mayor of London, Anno Dom.
1551. For six poor men of y<sup>e</sup> said Company.
Rebuilt by y<sup>e</sup> said Company Anno Dom. 1729.’
The original alms-houses are supposed to have
been further east.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Judd was a native of Tunbridge
in Kent, near which town he inherited considerable
estates. Having entered commercial life, he
made a large fortune by trading in furs, and, as
Stow tells us, he kept his mayoralty in a ‘fair
house’ in Bishopsgate Street, which had been
before used for a similar purpose by Sir William
Holles, the ancestor of the Earls of Clare. It
was during Judd’s mayoralty, in 1550, that the
City of London obtained from the King by charter
lands in Southwark, forming now so important a
property, and to which I alluded in my account of
the Dog and Duck, St. George’s Fields. Sir
Andrew was also buried in the church of Great
St. Helen’s, which has been a sort of Westminster
Abbey for great citizens. A quaint Elizabethan
monument marks his resting-place. The inscription
gives quite a little biography of him; as was
remarked by one of our Transatlantic cousins, ‘it
states all the facts, and rhymes in some places.’ In
the ‘Historical Collections of the Noble Families of
Cavendish, Holles, Vere, Harley and Ogle,’ ed.
Lond. 1752, compiled by Arthur Collins, it is
asserted that, in building the alms-houses, Judd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
was only acting as executor to his cousin ‘Elizabeth,
widow of Sir William Holles of St. Helen’s,
Alderman,’ and this seems to be shown by her
will, which was proved March 28, 1544. Stow,
however, does not mention her name in connection
with the charity. It was augmented by Sir
Andrew Judd’s daughter, Alice Smyth, of Westenhanger,
Kent. Sir Andrew had also been executor
to the Holles family. His original alms-houses
were nearer the church than those the site of
which the Skinners’ Company has now, I believe,
disposed of. He also founded and endowed Tunbridge
Grammar School.</p>

<p>Great St. Helen’s is being so rapidly ‘improved’
that it will soon become quite commonplace and
uninteresting. A piece was shorn off the churchyard
some years ago, no one exactly knew why,
and several picturesque plastered houses, immediately
west of Nos. 8 and 9, have been pulled
down within my memory. At the corner, opposite
to the pretty south porch of the church,
attributed by the Rev. Thomas Hugo to Inigo
Jones, a quaint and very old building still remains,
which actually touched the house of
the Lawrences. No. 10 is constructed of wood
and plaster, with projecting upper stories and
massive timbering; it dates from long before
the Great Fire; the inside, however, has been
modernized. Tradition boldly asserts that Anne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Boleyn’s father, Sir Thomas, afterwards Viscount
Rochford and Earl of Wiltshire, at one time
lived here. It is an undoubted fact that one of
the name was intimately connected with St.
Helen’s, for ‘on the 24th December, 26th
Hen. VIII., 1534, the Prioress and Convent
appointed Sir James Bolleyne, knt., to be steward
of their lands and tenements in London and
elsewhere, the duties to be performed either by
himself or a sufficient deputy, during the life
of the said James, at a stipend of forty shillings a
year, payable at Christmas. If in arrear for six
weeks the said James might enter and distrain.’
Query: was this Sir Thomas Boleyn’s elder brother?
There was a right of way hereabout from very
early times, for Dugdale tells us that in the
Hundred Roll of 3rd Edward I. several entries
occur relating to an attempt which the nuns
made to stop up the lane or passage through the
court of their nunnery from Bishopsgate Street to
St. Mary Axe, sometimes called St. Helen’s Lane.
If, as is possible, the house dates from before the
Dissolution of the Monasteries, when it first saw
the light there must have been few buildings near
the even then venerable Church of St. Helen and
the adjoining priory. Crosby Place, indeed, stood
hard by, on land leased from the nuns for a term of
ninety-nine years, but much open space yet remained.
Even as late as the end of last century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
there was a considerable field or garden immediately
to the east of the church, as shown in a
view by Malcolm dated 1799.</p>

<p>The buildings and grounds of Crosby Place
seem to have extended at first almost to Leadenhall
Street. The houses<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> in Crosby Square are
said to have been built about the year 1678, on
the site of some of the offices which had been
destroyed by fire. I cannot say how it happened
that in the early part of the seventeenth century a
house of considerable size had already been erected
on part of Crosby Place, or could it have been just
outside the precincts? This was latterly known
as No. 25, Bishopsgate Street Within, or Crosby
Hall Chambers. It succumbed to the pickaxe of
the builder as nearly as possible at the same time
as Adam Lawrence’s old residence in Great St.
Helen’s. The part facing Bishopsgate Street had
no sign of antiquity except two carved festoons
of flowers, much blocked up with paint,
between the first-floor windows. Up a passage,<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
however, one could see something of the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
side or front, which showed architectural features
of merit. It rested on round arches composed of
rustic work, and above were pilasters furnished
with capitals. On the first-floor, looking out on
this passage, there was a room adorned by a very
beautiful chimney-piece, with the initials <span class="smcap">g b</span> and
the date 1633 in the centre panel. The lower
part is of stone, the over-mantel of oak, in very
fine condition, all the delicacy of the carving
having been preserved by thick layers of paint,
which have just been removed. On the ceiling
of the same room there was also a fragment of
original plaster decoration, which has been presented
to the South Kensington Museum. The site of
Crosby Hall Chambers will be occupied by the
Bank of Scotland. It is proposed to put up the
chimney-piece in their new premises.</p>

<p>In 1857 the Rev. Thomas Hugo, F.S.A., wrote
an interesting itinerary of the Ward of Bishopsgate
for the journal of the London and Middlesex
Archæological Society. His paper was republished
in book form five years later; it contains valuable
illustrations of Nos. 8 and 9, Great St. Helen’s
and of Crosby Hall Chambers, besides other
houses which have passed away. The letterpress
is inspired by a fine enthusiasm; but his architectural
judgment is, I think, not altogether to
be relied on. He considers that both the above-named
buildings were designed by Inigo Jones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Austin Friars, another region in the heart of
the City perhaps as interesting as that which I
have just described, is, like it, rapidly being
transformed. Not long ago it still maintained
a distinctive character. Something of monastic
calm seemed to linger about the old home and
grounds of the begging friars, crowned by part of
their church, which since Edward VI.’s time has
been handed over to the Dutch congregation of
London. Outside, in Broad Street, there was the
roar and confusion of a mighty traffic; within the
sacred precinct there was peace: wheeled vehicles
seldom entered the very foot passengers, I have
thought, used to slacken their pace, and relax for a
moment the grim, determined look which, as a
rule, characterizes the man whose mind is bent on
business.</p>

<p>Passing round what remains of the old church,
one may still see a house&mdash;No. 10&mdash;which is an
excellent example of the real Queen Anne style;
to judge from the date on a rainpipe, it was probably
completed in the year 1704. The porch
has a flight of steps; ascending this, one finds
before one a spacious staircase panelled throughout,
and especially noticeable on account of its fine
painted ceiling, one of the last to be met with in a
City mansion. No. 11 forms part of the same
block of buildings.</p>

<p>Retracing our steps, we see standing back somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
from the main roadway, to the right of a new
passage just opened into what is called, in mockery,
Drapers’ Gardens, a tall new structure occupying
the site of another old brick mansion the associations
of which were very remarkable. The house
in question, No. 21, Austin Friars, had been built
during the latter part of the seventeenth century,
possibly even before the Great Fire, which did not
extend so far north; it seems to be marked in
Ogilby’s map of 1677. About the early possessors,
Richard Young and others, nothing is known of
any special interest. In the year 1705 it came into
the hands of Herman Olmius, merchant, whose
name occurs in the ‘Little London Directory’
for 1677, where he is described as of Angel Alley,
Bishopsgate Street Without. He was descended
from an ancient family of Arlon, in the duchy of
Luxemburg, and was naturalized by Act of Parliament,
29th Charles II. Here he lived and carried
on his business, and here, having made and inherited
a large fortune, he died in the year 1718.
His will shows that he was a member, not of the
Dutch congregation of the neighbouring church
in Austin Friars, but of the French Church in
Threadneedle Street, to which he left £150 for the
benefit of the poor. At the time of his death he
possessed four other houses in Austin Friars, ‘with
yards, gardens, and appurtenances,’ a shop called
the Crane in the Poultry, and another with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
sign of the Plough in Bucklersbury. He also
had much real property in Essex and elsewhere.
Herman was the son of Johannes Ludovicus or
John Lewis Olmius, and of his wife Margareta
Gerverdine. He married Judith, daughter and
heiress of John Drigue, who also appears to have
been living in Angel Court or Alley in 1677, and
who had also married an heiress, the daughter of
John Billers. Herman Olmius and his wife Judith
had no less than ten children, but only two of
them left offspring. These were his younger
daughter Margaret, wife of Adrian Lernoult, who
had predeceased him, and to whose descendants
the City property was bequeathed; and John
Olmius,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> born in 1670. This gentleman became
High Sheriff of Essex in 1707, a justice of the
peace, and Deputy-Lieutenant of the county. He
died December 20, 1731, being then Deputy-Governor
of the Bank of England. His wife
was Elizabeth, daughter and sole heiress of
Thomas Clarke, a descendant of the Clarkes of
St. Ives, Huntingdon, and probably her husband’s
cousin. Their son, also named John, was many
years member of Parliament, and received an Irish
peerage under the title of Lord Waltham. He
married Anne, daughter of Sir William Billers,
Lord Mayor in 1733, and left a son and a daughter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
The former died without issue in 1787, when the
family became extinct in the male line; the latter
having married John Luttrell, who was brother of
the Duchess of Cumberland,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and who became
third Earl of Carhampton, had a daughter, Frances
Maria, from whom is descended Sir Simeon Henry
Stuart, Bart. The Olmius family possessed much
land in Essex, and a large country seat at Boreham,
now used as a convent. At the Saracen’s Head
Hotel, Chelmsford, their fleeting dignity is still
represented by two fine hall-chairs emblazoned
with the Olmius crest, namely a demi-Moor in
armour between laurel branches, surmounted by a
baron’s coronet. My friend Mr. Francis Galton
would doubtless tell us that the failure of the family
in the male line resulted naturally from marriage
with heiresses and from intermarriage. Its rapid
rise had also, no doubt, been in part owing to the
former cause.</p>

<p>The house in Austin Friars continued for
several generations to belong to the descendants
of the younger daughter of Herman Olmius. In
1783 Hughes Minet came to live here, and in 1802<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
he bought a sixth share from three brothers named
Clarke, great-grandsons of Margaret Lernoult.
He was a merchant and banker, of Huguenot
descent, and his family had long carried on a
prosperous business at Dover. His descendant,
Mr. William Minet, has just written a very interesting
account of them. The Minets lived in
Austin Friars for many years, though they never
owned more than a sixth of the property. In
1838 Mr. Isaac Minet, the then representative
of the family, sold his share of the freehold,
and we find Messrs. Thomas, Son, and Lefevre
established here, the last-named being a brother of
the late Lord Eversley. The final owner was
Mr. John Fleming, by whose courtesy I had the
privilege of visiting the house on almost the last
day that it remained intact.</p>

<p>In point of fact, No. 21, Austin Friars was by
no means a striking specimen of architecture, but
having remained from the beginning practically
unchanged, there were points about it worthy of
record. Externally it was a plain four-storied
brick structure, the only piece of decoration being
a carved hood to the doorway which formed the
chief entrance from Austin Friars. Passing through
this, the visitor found himself in a hall, looking up a
broad winding staircase with twisted balusters. To
the right was the counting-house, panelled throughout
with South Carolina pine. It had an old Purbeck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
marble mantelpiece, on the upper line of which appeared
in white marble the Olmius arms,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> quartered
with those of the foreign families of Gerverdine,
Cappré, Drigue, and Reynstein. The double panes
above was worthy of remark as characteristic of
the time of Wren. Under an arch at the end of
the counting-house was a strong-room lined
throughout with Dutch tiles. Mounting the
staircase, one came upon the dining-room, with its
ingeniously contrived cupboard, and the drawing-room,
which looked out on what was, till within
the last few years, the pleasant and ample garden
of the Drapers’ Company, now covered, all but
a fragment, with bricks and mortar. A view
of this garden is given in Cassell’s ‘Old and New
London,’ vol. i., p. 517, with No. 21, Austin
Friars showing itself beyond the trees in the
middle distance; but no reference to it is made in
the letterpress. On the first-floor also, above the
chief office, was a small warehouse or sample-room,
an indispensable adjunct to the old merchant’s
dwelling,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Above were capital bedrooms, while a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
narrow staircase gave access to the tiled roof,
surrounded by a stone parapet. Retracing one’s
steps to the hall, one found, flanking a passage on
the side opposite to the counting-house, a lofty
kitchen still furnished with smoke-jack, spit-racks,
and iron caldron-holders, and adjoining the range
an oven lined with blue and white Dutch tiles,
no doubt a legacy of the Olmius family. Formerly,
also, most of the chimneypieces in the house were
fitted up with Dutch tiles, blue and white or red and
white; but these in course of time had disappeared.
In the basement were cellars, and close to them
an old surface well, which still contained water,
analyzed at the time of its destruction and found
to be little better than sewage. A door in the
passage was prettily carved. Through this one
passed to the outer offices, a brewery, wash-house,
coach-house and stables; and thence again there
was access by the side-entrance into the garden,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
quiet spot some half acre in extent, which no doubt
had originally formed part of the friars’ grounds.
It was connected by steps with a narrow terrace
running along the back of the house. Here in
the summer of 1888 I saw fig-trees still flourishing
while the work of destruction had already
begun.</p>

<p>The boundary at the end of this garden was
formed by another interesting house, No. 23,
Great Winchester Street, which has also lately been
improved out of existence. It occupied a good
deal of ground, being approached through a paved
yard with a lodge on each side of the entrance.
Externally its chief characteristics were a somewhat
high-pitched roof and wings projecting
forward. Inside the chief reception-room was
finely proportioned, with capital mouldings and
cornices, and there was an old kitchen range of
portentous size.</p>

<p>Close to this house, and also adjoining Drapers’
Garden, was formerly the garden attached to
the Carpenters’ Hall, so that a few years ago
this neighbourhood was a paradise of open spaces.
At the dissolution the house and gardens of
the Augustine Friars had been bestowed by
Henry VIII. on William Paulet, first Marquis of
Winchester, who there built his town residence,
traces of which existed as late as the year 1844:
after this mansion Winchester Street was named.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
From a date carved on a grotesque bracket
formerly to be seen at the north-east corner, it
appears that the street was constructed, partly at
least, in the year 1656, during Cromwell’s government.
Strype says that here was ‘a great messuage
called the Spanish Ambassador’s House, of late
inhabited by Sir James Houblon, Knight and
Alderman, and other fair houses.’ Even down to
our time it was a remarkably picturesque specimen
of a London street. Now nothing but the name
is left, to mark its connection with antiquity.</p>

<p>It may here be noted that even till comparatively
recent times almost every house in the City had a
garden, or at any rate some open space, belonging
to it, as may be proved by reference to old maps
and views. Horwood’s map, published in 1799,
shows how much garden ground still remained at
the end of last century. Besides this, before the
days of lifts, high pressure of water, and gas or
electric light laid on, the inconvenience of very
high houses prevented their being built to any
great extent. The comparative sparseness of the
population should undoubtedly have given our
ancestors a great advantage over us with regard to
health, but it was more than counterbalanced by
drawbacks resulting from ignorance&mdash;for example,
the use of impure water, and the inability to
grapple with diseases which are now comparatively
innocuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The disappearance of these open spaces, and the
erection of enormously high buildings on every
available spot, is, I believe, a great evil, not only
from the picturesque, but from the sanitary point
of view. Writers on sanitary subjects are agreed
that, of dangers to health, overcrowding is one of
the greatest, and that, other things being equal,
the death-rate regularly increases in proportion
to the density of the population. Dr. G. V.
Poore<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> has recently pointed out that every new
set of offices adds its quota to the sewage in the
river; while ‘the absence of green plants entails
a great loss of nascent oxygen or ozone which
gives to air its peculiar quality of freshness.’ In
his opinion, it is hardly conceivable that a high
level of health can be maintained in a spot where
vegetable life languishes, animal and vegetable
life being complementary to each other.</p>

<p>Some will no doubt console themselves with the
notion that, the City being now to a great extent
merely a place of business, those who spend the
day there (considerably more than a million, according
to the last calculation) can throw off
the ill effects while they are away. To this I
reply that, if one includes the outlying parts,
many thousands still make it their home, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
that, in any case, to spend a quarter of one’s
existence under most unhealthy conditions must
tend to cause illness and to shorten life. In these
times of popular government, the great City Guilds
are more or less on their probation. If I am
right, the Drapers’ Company, whatever the temptation
may have been, committed a fatal mistake when
they covered their garden with huge blocks of offices,
a mistake which can never be atoned for by any
amount of charitable donation. Their example has
been quickly followed, and soon, I fear, hardly one
breathing-space will remain in the City except the
ground about St. Paul’s and the Tower, and here
and there a bit of a disused graveyard hemmed in
by lofty offices and warehouses.</p>

 Pye, <i>i.e.</i>, parti-coloured, as in the bird. It is said to have
been so called because the initial and principal letters of the
rubrics were printed in red, and the rest in black. At the
beginning of the Church of England Prayer-Book, in that
section which relates to the service of the Church, mention
is made of ‘the number and hardness of the rules called the
Pie.’ Shakespeare, in the ‘Merry Wives of Windsor,’ says,
‘By cocke and pie you shall not choose, sir; you shall not
choose, but come.’ In this asseveration cock is supposed to
be a euphemism for God, and pie the above-named ordinal.</p>

In style it reminds one somewhat of the Guildhall
giants, Gog and Magog, or, as Fairholt would call them,
Corineus and Gogmagog. These appear to have been made
in 1708, by Richard Saunders, a captain of trained bands and
carver in King Street, Cheapside, to replace giants of pasteboard
and wickerwork, which had been carried in City processions.</p>

Part of a similar crypt is to be seen at 4a, Lawrence
Pountney Hill; it belonged to a house called the Manor of
the Rose, built originally in the reign of Edward III. Such
crypts would doubtless be useful to mediæval merchants for
the storage of goods. There are great cellars under Crosby
Hall. I am reminded that in the thirteenth century houses
furnished usually belonged to Kings or the higher nobility&mdash;at
least, this is implied by Matthew Paris, in his ‘Lives of the
Abbots of St. Albans.’ His words are: ‘Aula nobilissima

In fourteenth and fifteenth century paintings, especially

the tradition being that he was King of Ethiopia or Nubia.
Ghirlandajo, in a picture at the Pitti Gallery, gives him, not
a black complexion, but a black page. The difference of race
indicated in the representations of the Three Kings implies
the wideness of the manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles.
On this account the three sons of Noah have been looked

Whitechapel Mount was an elevation of ground generally
thought to have been composed, in part at least, of
rubbish from the Great Fire: Lysons, however, denies this.
Another idea is, that it was a great burial-place for victims of
the Plague of 1665. A fort was built here in 1642, one of
the series then thrown round London. The Mount is
shown in Strype’s map of 1720, and in a view of London
Hospital, by Chatelain. Towards the end of last century
it was a place of resort for pugilists and dog-fighters. Mount
Street and Mount Place, immediately west of the London
Hospital, Whitechapel Road, now occupy the ground, which
is still slightly raised.</p>

Pepys, the diarist, on March 27, 1664, writes as follows:
‘Walked through the Ducking Pond Fields; but they are so
altered since my father used to carry us to Islington, to the
old man of the King’s Head, to eat cakes and ale (his name
was Pitts), that I did not know which was the Ducking Pond,
or where I was.’ What would he have said now? There
were several ducking-ponds in this neighbourhood; the name
of Ball’s Pond, near Newington Green, still survives. Howes
in his ‘Chronicle’ says that the reservoir at the New River head
‘was in former times an open idell pool, commonly called the
Ducking Pond.’ Spa Fields, Clerkenwell, were also called
‘Ducking Pond Fields.’ There was a public-house a little
west of the London Spa, with a ducking-pond attached. It
was taken down in 1770, and the Pantheon, in imitation of
the Oxford Street Pantheon, built on its site. This soon
became disreputable, and was eventually turned into Spa
Fields Chapel, demolished 1879. There was a ducking-pond
in Mayfair (Hertford Street is on the site), and another near
Mile End.</p>

 The cross had possibly some connection with the priory
of St. Mary Overy hard by, or with the rich and powerful
abbey, originally the priory of St. Saviour’s, Bermondsey.
A chronicle, supposed to have been written by one of
the monks, is among the Harleian MSS. (No. 231). We
are here told that in the year 1117 ‘the cross of the Holy
Saviour was found near the Thames.’ Apparently this
was the cross of Bermondsey, placed in the church, to which
pilgrimages were occasionally made. It was taken down in
1538, during the mayoralty of Sir Richard Gresham, and in
all likelihood destroyed; but Wilkinson, in his ‘Londina
Illustrata,’ gives a view, showing in front of the building,
attached to the chief or north gate of the abbey, a small
cross with zigzag ornament, which some have sought to
identify with this holy rood. It existed with the remains of
the building till comparatively recent times. On the way to
the abbey were famous roadside crosses: one north, the site
of which is at the junction of Tooley Street with Bermondsey
Street; the other south, in Kent Street.</p>

The gatehouse had only been finished in the year 1728,

From early days, however, the fair had increased beyond
church limits, and the City had acquired certain rights.
In the fourth edition of Stow, 1633, we are told how, on
Bartholomew Eve, the Aldermen in their violet gowns met
the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs at the Guildhall chapel, and
how they rode into Cloth Fair, and made a proclamation,
riding back through the churchyard and home to the Lord
Mayor’s house.</p>

The rebus was invented before Prior Bolton’s time;
as early as 1443 the White Friars had a grant of the ‘Hospitium

I have not been able to find proof positive that a Fowler
owned this property. The house, though of respectable
antiquity, is much more modern than the arms. By a lease
dated 1722, a messuage called the Bell, with its stables, etc.,
and two other messuages or tenements on either side, adjoining
and fronting High Street, Holborn, ‘formerly one
capital mansion or messuage called the Bell or Blue Bell Inn,
together with all shops, stables, and other appurtenances,’
were bought by Christ’s Hospital for £2,113 15s. Together
with the adjoining house, it still belongs to the Hospital.
There is a rent-charge of 45s. (originally 30 sacks of charcoal)
on the Blue Bell Inn, for the use of the poor of St.
Andrews, in which parish the houses are situated; it was bequeathed
by Richard Hunt, who died in 1559.</p>

The pretty garden of Clement’s Inn is now being built
over, and the garden house will soon disappear behind
bricks and mortar. The black kneeling figure supporting a
sundial, which formerly decorated the lawn (having been
brought from Italy and presented to the Inn by one of the
Earls of Clare), was sold by the Ancients in 1884 for twenty
guineas, and has now found its way to Inner Temple
Gardens.</p>

The parish derived its name from a holy well, at which
the parish clerks of London used annually to perform a miracle
play. Its site was marked by a pump near the south-east
corner of Ray Street, an illustration of which is given in
Wilkinson’s ‘Londina Illustrata.’ The well still exists a few
feet to the north, covered by a massive brick arch, under
the floor of No. 18, Farringdon Road&mdash;formerly the parish
watch-house. This quaint little tenement is now to be let
on building lease. The whole neighbourhood seems in old
days to have had a reputation for holy and medicinal wells.</p>

The springs thus named were almost on the site of
another medicinal spring called Black Mary’s Well or Hole.
Dr. Bevis makes them out the same, and suggests that the
title by which the latter had been known was a corruption
of ‘Blessed Mary’s Hole.’ Other writers seek to derive it
from Mary Woolaston&mdash;a black woman who about 1680 is
supposed to have lived hereabout, by the side of the road, in
a circular hut built of stones, and to have leased and sold the
waters. According to the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> for 1813,
part ii., p. 557, this spring was afterwards enclosed in a
conduit by Walter Baynes, Esq., the gentleman who, in 1697,
discovered the famous Cold Bath, and who owned, in part at
least, the Sir John Oldcastle tavern and gardens hard by.
According to a plan of the city and environs of London, as
fortified by Parliament in 1642-3, there was a battery and
breastwork ‘on the hill E. of Blackmary’s Hole.’</p>

In Miss Burney’s ‘Evelina’ (chap. xlv.), published
January, 1778, there is an interesting list of places of amusement
in the suburbs. The vulgar members of the Branghton
family, and others, dispute as to which they shall visit in the
evening. Miss Branghton votes for Saltero’s coffee-house;
her sister for a party at Mother Red Cap’s; the brother for
White Conduit House; Mr. Brown for Bagnigge Wells;
Mr. Branghton for Sadler’s Wells, and Mr. Smith for
Vauxhall. White Conduit House is at last fixed upon. The
site of this is marked by a public-house&mdash;No. 14, Barnsbury
Road; it was named after an ancient conduit which once
stood hard by.</p>

I do not guarantee the completeness of the following
list of work in the City said to have been by Inigo Jones,
but it may be useful for reference. The Church of St.
Catherine Cree, Leadenhall Street, has been popularly
ascribed to him; it was consecrated by Laud, January 16,
1630-31, and is in pseudo-Gothic style. The Classic portico
to old St. Paul’s Cathedral was designed by Jones in 1633.
The repairs under his supervision were begun in April, 1631,
and carried on for more than nine years. The Church of
St. Alban’s, Wood Street, may have been his work; it replaced
the old church, pulled down in 1632. This was destroyed
in the Great Fire. The hall, theatre, and court-room
of the Barber-Surgeons’ Company were built by him, apparently
in 1636. The hall was destroyed in the Great
Fire; the theatre, which had been restored by the Earl of
Burlington, was pulled down in 1763. It has been stated
that the latter rebuilt the court-room; Mr. Young, however,
in his ‘Annals of the Barber-Surgeons’ (1890), declares positively
that it is the work of Inigo Jones, repaired after the
Fire. He is said to have also built Thanet House, Aldersgate
Street, which survived till 1882.</p>

On the 15th of April, 1630, occurs the following entry:
‘Petronela Laurence widdowe, a Dutchwoman, was buryed
in ye ten shilling ground, att lower end of ye men’s pewes.’
I am tempted to add the following curious baptismal entry
from the register. ‘Sept. 1, 1611.&mdash;Job-rakt-out-of-the-asshes,
being borne the last of August, in the lane going to Sir
John Spencer’s back gate and there laide in a heape of seacole
asshes, was baptized the first day of September following and
dyed the next day after.’</p>

The name is spelt in various ways. He may have been
of the family of Sir John Cullum, Sheriff of London in
1646, on the site of whose mansion Cullum Street, hard by,
is built.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_98_98" id="Footnote_98_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_98_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a></span>
From this I infer that she and her husband came to live
in the parish after Adam’s death. Their son John was born
December, 1661, and died a few months afterwards.</p>

Dr. Cox mentions this. Having searched for Sir John
Lawrence’s will at Somerset House, I find that he died intestate,
and that administration of his estate was granted to his
widow Catherine; so he had married a second time. In this
grant he is described as ‘nuper de Putney.’ It appears from
the register of that parish that he had a young family, and this
is confirmed by a Lawrence pedigree which has been kindly
placed at my disposal. Among the children there was another
son John, who married Catherine Briscoe; he died in 1728,
leaving several daughters and a son of the same name. There
was also a son Adam, who left no issue. Catherine, Lady Lawrence,
was buried in the vault at St. Helen’s Church in 1723.</p>

Faulkner gives some verses which he says were written
about the year 1664 on the Lawrence arms. Here is a
specimen:</p>
<p class="pfp6s">‘The Field is Argent, and the charge a Cross:<br />
Riches without Religion are but dross;<br />
White, like this field, O Lord, his life should be<br />
Who bears thy cross, follows, and fights for thee.’</p>

1718, which would be seventy-six years after his first marriage.</p>

This passage, to judge from a restored plan in Hammon’s
‘Architectural Antiquities of Crosby Place’ (London, 1844),
was one of the original courts of Crosby Place; but I am
rather doubtful about it. According to this plan, Crosby
Square occupied the site, not of offices, but of the bowling-green.</p>

Anne, daughter of Simon Luttrell, created Baron Irnham

In 1778 John Drigue Lernoult and another let the
house to Lewis Miol, and a schedule was then drawn up
which I have seen. Everything is most carefully noted
from the arch in the hall ‘with fluted columns and carved
capitals,’ to the ‘battlement wall about 2 feet 6 inches high,
coped with stone cornice.’ At that time there was a warehouse
with a loft over it, and a crane, but its position is not

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
